MC,H1,1,4,5,4,0,34,600,306,-2447,680,38,app vs android namespace,
MC,P,1,124,5,124,0,21,400,306,-2391,680,368,you might have noticed that some attributes are referenced by  and others just by . this is because some are defined by the android platform and as such you need the  part to reference them by their namespace (just like with view attributes in layouts: ). those without come from static libraries (i.e. appcompat or mdc) which are compiled into your application so don’t need the namespace (similar to how you might use  in a layout). some elements are defined  in the platform and in a library e.g. . in these cases prefer the non-platform version as this can be used on all api levels i.e. they’re duplicated in a library precisely to backport them. in these cases i’ve listed the non-platform versions above.,
MC,H1,1,2,7,2,1,34,600,306,-1902,680,38,more resources,

MC,P,3,35,5,35,0,21,400,306,-1344,680,128,sometimes there isn’t a theme attribute which abstracts something you’d like to vary by theme. no worries… create your own! here’s an example from the  which shows a list of conference sessions in two screens.,google i/o app
MC,P,1,51,5,51,0,21,400,306,-650,680,128,they’re largely similar but the left screen must leave space for the sticky time headers while the right screen does not. we implemented this by abstracting where to align items behind a theme attribute so that we can vary them by theme and use the same layout across two different screens:,

MC,P,2,52,5,52,0,21,400,306,490,680,160,knowing what theme attributes are available equips you to use them when writing your layouts styles or drawables. using theme attributes makes it much easier to support theming (like ) and to write more flexible maintainable code. for a deep dive on this join us in our next post in this series:,dark theme
MC,H1,1,4,8,4,0,40,400,306,-26383,680,48,unity: android optimization guide,
MC,P,1,13,6,13,0,21,400,306,-26224,680,64,everything’s fine until you realize your lack of optimization is killing your game!,
MC,H1,1,1,12,1,1,34,600,306,-25250,680,38,introduction,
MC,P,1,34,5,34,0,21,400,306,-25195,680,96,as everyone working with unity on android or ios project you are at some point confronted to performances issues fps drops latency lags and so on that disturb your game or even ruin it…,
MC,P,1,17,4,17,0,21,400,306,-25066,680,96,you can be sure that the time has come to dig into your project and optimize it!,
MC,H1,1,3,5,3,0,34,600,306,-23898,680,38,profile your game,
MC,STRONG,1,2,7,2,1,26,700,306,-23817,134,31,unity profiler,
MC,P,1,45,5,45,0,21,400,306,-23775,680,128,in order to watch and analyze your project performances you must use the unity  (window > profiler). it allows you see graphically how your game is doing what takes time to compute how long is the rendering per frame what is sucking all your performances.,
MC,P,1,56,5,56,0,21,400,306,-23615,680,160,it is really easy to use you just have to click on the graphic on spikes for example to get details on the frame computing. unity shows you the processes that take the most time. in order to understand those processes don’t hesitate to just google their names you’ll find a forum post talking about it.,
MC,P,1,23,4,23,0,21,400,306,-23002,680,128,the unity editor is dealing with other processes than just the game thus it runs slower than a simple build of your game.,
MC,STRONG,1,27,4,27,0,21,700,306,-22999,675,90,the unity works in the editor and shows you how your game is doing in it but be aware that it doesn’t represent your game’s real performances.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,7,2,1,26,700,306,-22840,157,31,remote profiler,
MC,P,1,14,5,14,0,21,400,306,-22799,680,64,that’s why you must build your game and profile it from your android device!,
MC,P,10,45,4,45,0,21,400,306,-22703,680,192,once you’ve  you can use the remote profiler. in the build settings (file > build settings…) you just have to check “” and “” and be sure that in the editor settings (edit > project settings > editor) that “” is put on “”.,configured the android sdk and jdk to build you project
MC,P,1,29,5,29,0,21,400,306,-21740,680,96,now you have to launch your game on your device while plugged to the computer and normally you’ll see in unity the window show up with your device’s stats.,
MC,P,1,17,5,17,0,21,400,306,-21612,680,64,if not open the window and in the “” dropdown button select “” something. that’s your device.,
MC,STRONG,1,20,6,20,0,21,700,306,-21512,629,58,profiling directly your device will give you so much more accurate information on your game performances so prefer this method.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,5,2,1,26,700,306,-20580,97,31,editor log,
MC,P,1,44,4,44,0,21,400,306,-20539,680,128,one other great tool to get information on your build is to open the . just after building your game open the console window (window > console) and on the top right you have a button that you can click on to select “”.,
MC,P,1,38,5,38,0,21,400,306,-20379,680,96,it will open you a document with many informations on your build especially information on your build size and the assets that take space. just scroll down the document until you find something that looks like this :,
MC,STRONG,1,5,6,5,0,26,700,306,-19926,339,31,test regularly on different devices,
MC,P,1,28,5,28,0,21,400,306,-19885,680,96,the plurality of android devices is a big difficulty for android development as one problem or performance issue can appear on one device but not on the other.,
MC,STRONG,1,27,4,27,0,21,700,306,-19754,648,90,that’s why you must test your game on different devices to prevent problems and to be sure that it is compatible with a large number of phones.,
MC,P,1,50,5,50,0,21,400,306,-19628,680,160,of course it’s tempting to do the optimization at the end of the project but you’ll find yourself sinking under many performances issues. it’s preferable to regularly profile your game at big milestones for example. indeed with lesser modifications on the game you’ll find what is sucking your performances quicker.,
MC,H1,1,1,7,1,1,34,600,306,-19352,680,38,scripts,
MC,P,1,49,5,49,0,21,400,306,-19297,680,160,before getting into the big stuff with rendering optimization we want our scripts to be beyond reproach. indeed if like me you’re a programmer and you’re working with artists it would be preferable to check your scripts performances before blaming the artists (even if everything is surely their fault!).,
MC,STRONG,1,5,6,5,0,26,700,306,-19102,325,31,don’t put everything in update(),
MC,P,1,57,4,57,0,21,400,306,-19061,680,160,one of the biggest mistake of unity beginners is to rely too much on the  function. it’s quite easy to just put everything in it check this or that state and to react accordingly but if every  in your scene has an  function checking many things and realizing complex actions this could be heavy on android performances.,
MC,P,1,11,5,11,0,21,400,306,-18869,680,64,so before using anything in the  function reflect on your needs.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,7,2,1,26,700,306,-18771,153,31,use coroutines,
MC,P,1,12,5,12,0,21,400,306,-18729,680,32,if it doesn’t then you have several options to be more efficient.,
MC,P,1,25,4,25,0,21,400,306,-18665,680,96,you can use to call a method only every second for example using the instruction: “” it could be used to refresh some ui display:,
MC,P,1,22,5,22,0,21,400,306,-18287,680,96,or you can wait every two frames and call your method with:“”for example to process a complex calculations but not every frame.,
MC,STRONG,1,5,7,5,0,26,700,306,-17885,432,31,use events actions reactive programming,
MC,P,1,36,4,36,0,21,400,306,-17844,680,96,what could be really efficient is to call your methods only when you need it for example when this variable changes this method is called or when that event occurs display and ui pops up …,
MC,STRONG,1,15,4,15,0,21,700,306,-17713,639,58,this is the principle of  to work with events where an action calls reactions.,
MC,P,1,6,4,6,0,21,400,306,-17620,680,96,in c# you can use delegates:,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate
MC,P,1,3,9,3,0,21,400,306,-17491,680,64,action delegates especially:,https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.action(v=vs.110).aspx
MC,P,1,26,4,26,0,21,400,306,-17395,680,64,they allow you to create events that you have to call when they occur and those events call all the methods that have subscribed to it.,
MC,P,1,57,4,57,0,21,400,306,-17299,680,160,for example you create an event “onplayerjump” that you call every time in your code you make your player jump and you subscribe to this event a method creating some dust fx or an event playing a jump sound. that’s just a very little introduction and you should look into it if you don’t know about it.,
MC,STRONG,1,7,6,7,0,26,700,306,-16841,523,31,use raycasts to detect your touchable gameobjects,
MC,P,1,33,4,33,0,21,400,306,-16800,680,96,in unity except for the ui there aren’t any easy way to detect a tap touch on a  on the screen. you can use the  functions but unity prevents its use on smartphones.,
MC,P,1,35,4,35,0,21,400,306,-16671,680,96,so what you can do is to use  starting from the camera and going where the finger touched the screen and if you touch a certain object type you call a method on it.,
MC,P,1,23,3,23,0,21,400,306,-16543,680,64,that’s what i do i have a lass a layer and when a touch occurs on the screen i use the method :,
MC,P,1,21,3,21,0,21,400,306,-16057,680,64,it detects if the touch is on a  and if it’s the case i then call the  method on the .,
MC,H1,1,1,7,1,1,34,600,306,-15877,680,38,physics,
MC,P,1,43,4,43,0,21,400,306,-15821,680,128,now that you checked your scripts you’ll surely want to check how you manage the physics interactions if you have some. on mobile it would be better to have none but it you have to you must be careful on certain simple things.,
MC,P,1,17,5,17,0,21,400,306,-15661,680,64,try to have the least dynamic as possible because they demand a lot of performance to compute.,
MC,P,1,12,4,12,0,21,400,306,-15564,680,64,use simple  instead of that are so much more complex to process.,
MC,P,1,14,4,14,0,21,400,306,-15468,680,64,try to keep the “” on “” if possible as “” demands more performance.,
MC,P,1,30,4,30,0,21,400,306,-15372,680,96,and lastly you can go to the window (edit > project settings > time) and tweak the “” value. this value represents the duration between two calls of the method.,
MC,P,1,46,5,46,0,21,400,306,-14922,680,128,so if you lower the the physics calculation will be called more often leading to a more accurate simulation but taking many ressources. on the other hand rising it up could maybe reduce your physics simulation time especially if you don’t need a very accurate simulation.,
MC,H1,1,1,8,1,1,34,600,306,-14678,680,38,lighting,
MC,P,1,13,5,13,0,21,400,306,-14623,680,32,now let’s get to the rendering optimization part! first of all the lighting!,
MC,STRONG,1,22,6,22,0,21,700,306,-14555,627,90,if possible don’t use dynamic lighting and prefer unlit textures as lighting calculations take much resources especially with many objects to render.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,7,2,1,26,700,306,-14428,150,31,baked lighting,
MC,P,1,32,4,32,0,21,400,306,-13924,680,96,you can use  if it suits your project as it calculates and “paints” the lighting directly onto the textures once and so it won’t process it any more during the game.,
MC,P,1,25,5,25,0,21,400,306,-13732,680,96,it allows you to put many lights to create complex lighting scenes without thinking about the performances as everything will be baked onto the textures.,
MC,P,1,33,5,33,0,21,400,306,-13603,680,96,but of course you’ll lose all the advantages of a dynamic lighting like the dynamic shadows and your moving objects could feel out of place when progressing through the level without light changement.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,6,2,1,26,700,306,-13473,125,31,light probes,
MC,P,1,11,5,11,0,21,400,306,-13432,680,64,you can somewhat counter this problem by using light probes :,https://docs.unity3d.com/manual/lightprobes.html
MC,P,1,35,5,35,0,21,400,306,-13335,680,96,those probes also store light information during the light baking not on textures but on empty spaces. this way when objects move around light probes areas there are falsely lit by the light previously baked.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,8,2,1,26,700,306,-12712,178,31,shadow projector,
MC,P,1,41,5,41,0,21,400,306,-12671,680,160,another thing you can do is to fake the dynamic shadows under the main characters.you could just put a round dark shape texture moving around with your character to represent his shadow like old animated movies if it suits your game.,
MC,P,1,42,4,42,0,21,400,306,-11994,680,96,or you can use a shadow projector that uses the object mesh to project under it a fake shadow that isn’t as realistic as one with dynamic lighting but maybe it would be enough for your project and it takes less resources!,
MC,H1,1,1,7,1,1,34,600,306,-11519,680,38,shadows,
MC,P,1,26,3,26,0,21,400,306,-11463,680,64,if you have to use a dynamic light be sure to use them as least at possible and to use only one  for your whole game.,
MC,P,1,48,5,48,0,21,400,306,-11367,680,160,of course what is important when using dynamic lighting especially in a 3d world are the realistic shadows but that’s what takes the most resources to render in the lighting process.nevertheless there are some values we can play with to get the shadows we want without sacrificing performances.,
MC,STRONG,1,3,8,3,0,26,700,306,-11172,256,31,directional light settings,
MC,P,1,29,4,29,0,21,400,306,-11131,680,96,on your only  you can begin by setting the culling mask with only the layer of  you want to project light upon as we don’t want unnecessary calculations.,
MC,P,1,64,5,64,0,21,400,306,-11003,680,192,play with the  setting to see which one is satisfying enough of course a lower resolution takes lesser resources. but be aware that what you see in the editor doesn’t represent what will be displayed on your device so for example a  setting could be perceived as really pixelated on your computer but could be enough on your device. always build and test directly.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,8,2,1,26,700,306,-10777,162,31,quality settings,
MC,P,1,16,5,16,0,21,400,306,-10735,680,64,now open the  (edit > project settings > quality) and let’s dig into those advanced settings.,
MC,P,1,10,4,10,0,21,400,306,-10639,680,32,here’s what your window should look like for now :,
MC,P,1,14,5,14,0,21,400,306,-9671,680,64,those settings really influence your game performance so try to get familiar with it.,
MC,P,1,20,4,20,0,21,400,306,-9574,680,96,in order to reduce the light calculations lower the “” to 1 or 0 if you don’t have any lights.,
MC,EM,1,2,6,2,1,21,700,306,-9571,114,26,pixel count:,
MC,P,1,11,5,11,0,21,400,306,-9446,680,96,disable the  if possible because it takes many resources on mobile.,
MC,EM,1,1,13,1,1,21,700,306,-9443,122,26,antialiasing:,
MC,P,1,13,4,13,0,21,400,306,-9318,680,64,if you don’t have a specific use of soft particles also disable it.,
MC,EM,1,2,7,2,1,21,700,306,-9314,131,26,soft particles:,
MC,P,1,19,5,19,0,21,400,306,-9221,680,128,now the shadows are the real important settings to play with.as  demand more resources you can select “” option.,
MC,EM,1,1,8,1,1,21,700,306,-9218,91,26,shadows:,
MC,P,1,40,4,40,0,21,400,306,-9061,680,128,but with this option at a very low resolution the shadows are really pixelated and edgy. so what you can do is pass the option “” from “” to “” and you’ll see that the shadows are now less pixelated.,
MC,P,1,19,5,19,0,21,400,306,-8901,680,64,don’t worry if it seems ugly on your computer screen remember to build and directly test on your device!,
MC,P,1,6,3,6,0,21,400,306,-8804,680,32,now set the “” to “”.,
MC,P,1,52,5,52,0,21,400,306,-8740,680,160,then finally tweak the “” value reducing it slowly. you’ll see at some point that far shadows are disappearing. indeed this value represents the distance at which the shadows are processed. shadows beyond this distance aren’t calculated. so reduce this value until you’re satisfied with your shadows while having a lower “”.,
MC,P,1,9,4,9,0,21,400,306,-8548,680,32,so now your  window should look like this :,
MC,H1,1,1,8,1,1,34,600,306,-7495,680,38,textures,
MC,P,1,31,4,31,0,21,400,306,-7440,680,96,when you’ll look into your  you’ll surely see that your textures are taking the most memory in your game. indeed too often they are way too big for their purpose.,
MC,P,1,28,4,28,0,21,400,306,-7311,680,96,so what you can do before you start complaining about your artists is to go in your textures “” just click on your textures in your “” window.,
MC,LI,1,23,5,23,0,21,400,336,-7183,650,96,click on the “” arrow and now check “” unity especially recommends it for faster texture loading time and a lower rendering time.,
MC,LI,1,26,5,26,0,21,400,336,-6850,650,96,then you can play with the “” option that compresses the texture in order to reduce its memory footprint. indeed the textures are often too big.,
MC,LI,1,32,5,32,0,21,400,336,-6742,650,96,take in account their purposes (character texture ui sprites environment texture etc) you should try to reduce the “max size” as low as possible as long as the visual aspect suits you.,
MC,LI,1,32,5,32,0,21,400,336,-6094,650,96,finally to reduce the draw calls you can use textures atlases. atlases are big textures files containing several or all of your game textures. this can really lead to great performance gains!,

MC,P,1,35,5,35,0,21,400,306,-5826,680,96,another big chapter in unity android optimization is the ui optimization. because as you’ll see the unity ui system isn’t really well optimized but luckily you can find smart ideas to get the best performances!,
MC,STRONG,1,1,7,1,1,26,700,306,-5696,71,31,sprites,
MC,P,1,25,5,25,0,21,400,306,-5655,680,96,when using sprites for your ui be sure that your sprites have as less transparent areas as possible because those create overdraw and reduce performances.,
MC,P,1,22,5,22,0,21,400,306,-5526,680,64,like the textures you can put all your ui sprites into an atlas while reducing their “max size” to a minimum acceptable.,
MC,P,1,29,4,29,0,21,400,306,-5430,680,96,also check “” option it is really important for your ui as it will not only take less time to render but also make it smoother on your screen.,

MC,P,1,24,4,24,0,21,400,306,-5258,680,96,in unity the ui works with a  try to have as less as possible because a represents extra calculus for the rendering process.,
MC,P,1,40,5,40,0,21,400,306,-5130,680,128,maybe you have that are only used in a display purpose without need for interaction. in this case remove the “” component on it as it implies that the canvas will be interacted with and has to check for interactions.,
MC,P,1,17,5,17,0,21,400,306,-4970,680,64,also to gain in performance just uncheck the “” option! you’ll see great results especially with .,
MC,STRONG,1,3,4,3,0,26,700,306,-3988,149,31,texts & images,
MC,P,1,8,6,8,0,21,400,306,-3947,680,32,the components can be really resource-demanding on mobile!,
MC,P,1,10,3,10,0,21,400,306,-3883,680,32,so what you can do is disable “” on it.,
MC,P,1,21,4,21,0,21,400,306,-3819,680,64,on and components that aren’t interacted with you can uncheck “” on it as it will remove them from any calculus.,
MC,P,1,29,4,29,0,21,400,306,-3722,680,64,unity recommends not to use the “” option on to many  but i haven’t tested this yet so i can’t say if this is really a bad habit.,
MC,STRONG,1,1,5,1,1,26,700,306,-3130,56,31,fonts,
MC,P,1,47,5,47,0,21,400,306,-3089,680,160,with your  you’ll surely use custom fonts but be careful because with some bad quality fonts found on internet you could have performance issues. try to keep a small font count and if you have performance issues try to disable the “” option on all your components.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,5,2,1,26,700,306,-2894,111,31,ui material,
MC,P,1,24,4,24,0,21,400,306,-2853,680,64,i saw this tip on a forum and i confirm that when you leave the “” empty on and components your performances are slower.,
MC,P,1,25,3,25,0,21,400,306,-2757,680,64,so what you can do is create a new in your project and set its  to “” and put this material on every and .,

MC,P,1,36,4,36,0,21,400,306,-1997,680,128,the is a ui component similar to the  but it has the advantage of disabling ui elements when they are outside of the mask area and thus aren’t rendered. this can help improve the performances.,
MC,STRONG,1,2,5,2,1,26,700,306,-1835,106,31,scroll rect,
MC,P,1,48,4,48,0,21,400,306,-1794,680,128,another ui component the  is used to display a lot of content hiding a part of it and scroll through it. it is really cool and nice to interact with it but try not to use too much of it because it really isn’t optimized for mobile.,
MC,P,1,12,5,12,0,21,400,306,-1634,680,64,you can also use the previous component the to improve the performances.,
MC,STRONG,1,5,6,5,0,26,700,306,-1535,365,31,canvas group and menu animations,
MC,P,1,28,5,28,0,21,400,306,-1494,680,96,when animating the menu elements naturally you would enable and disable the elements when showing on and off off the screen but this isn’t the most optimized way.,
MC,P,1,28,5,28,0,21,400,306,-1366,680,96,indeed disabling and enabling can restart some processes on certain . for example the previous  component repopulates and reloads its content when enabling which can cause lag spikes.,
MC,P,1,12,4,12,0,21,400,306,-1237,680,64,the other possibility is to let the enabled but to use .,
MC,P,1,52,5,52,0,21,400,306,-827,680,160,those components are really useful they allow to group elements up and control their behavior as a whole. you can play with the opacity “” of the group and disable their interactivity with the “” and “” options. so use these options to make sure that hidden menus can’t be interacted with.,

MC,P,1,33,4,33,0,21,400,306,-367,680,96,i’m really not an expert on so i can just warn you about how optimizing on mobile is important and recommend you to take a look on the internet how to do so.,

MC,P,1,40,4,40,0,21,400,306,-142,680,96,what i can surely say is that post processing shaders are really expensive in resources so try not to use them on mobile or optimize and test them to be sure that the game doesn’t suffer too much from it.,

MC,P,1,20,5,20,0,21,400,306,-3694,680,64,local health departments will lead these efforts and the state department of health and its partners will support this work.,
MC,P,1,52,5,52,0,21,400,306,-2876,680,160,people should confine at home immediately upon first symptoms. people testing positive need to confine at home until at least 10 days have passed since first symptoms and at least 72 hours have passed without a fever (without use of fever-reducing medication) and they see improvement in cough or shortness of breath.,
MC,P,1,40,5,40,0,21,400,306,-2684,680,96,when someone tests positive for covid-19 an interviewer will reach out by phone. they will ask who that person has been in close contact with then reach out to those other people to let them know they have been exposed.,

MC,LI,1,53,5,53,0,15,400,284,-149,629,77,your code is correct in the sense that it produces the correct result. explicitely iterating over the rows of a dataframe is as a rule however not so good an idea in terms of performance. most often the same result can be achieved far more efficiently by pandas methods (as you demonstrated yourself).,
MC,LI,1,32,5,32,0,15,400,284,-65,629,58,pandas is so fast because it uses numpy under the hood. numpy implements highly efficient array operations. also the original creator of pandas wes mckinney is kinda obsessed with efficiency and speed.,
MC,LI,2,61,5,61,0,15,400,284,0,629,96,use numpy or other optimized libraries. i recommend reading the  section of the pandas docs. if you can't use built-in pandas methods if often makes sense to retrieve a numpy respresentation of the dataframe or series (using the  attribute or  method) do all the calculations on the numpy array and only then store the result back to the dataframe or series.,enhancing performance

MC,P,1,60,5,60,0,15,400,254,607,659,77,this does indeed result in all numbers between 1 and  inclusive exactly once before the sequence repeats again. since the next state is based on multiplication the state can never be zero (or all future states would also be zero). thus the repeated number you see is the first one and zero is the one that is never returned.,
MC,P,1,62,5,62,0,15,400,254,699,659,96,apple has been promoting the use of better random number generators in their documentation and examples for at least as long as macos (or os x) has existed so the quality of  is probably not deemed important and they've just stuck with one of the simplest pseudorandom generators available.

MC,P,1,63,5,63,0,15,400,76,-9231,750,90,but the question still remains – do pretrained word embeddings give an extra edge to our nlp model? that’s an important point you should know the answer to. so in this article i will shed some light on the importance of pretrained word embeddings. we’ll also compare the performance of pretrained word embeddings and learning embeddings from scratch for a sentiment analysis problem.,

MC,P,1,13,6,13,0,15,400,76,-8648,750,22,let’s answer the big question straightaway – what exactly are pretrained word embeddings?,
MC,P,1,18,5,18,0,18,300,151,-8573,650,53,pretrained word embeddings are the embeddings learned in one task that are used for solving another similar task.,
MC,P,1,24,5,24,0,15,400,76,-8468,750,45,these embeddings are trained on large datasets saved and then used for solving other tasks. that’s why pretrained word embeddings are a form of,
MC,P,2,52,5,52,0,15,400,76,-7927,750,67,transfer learning as the name suggests is about transferring the learnings of one task to another. learnings could be either weights or embeddings. in our case here learnings are the embeddings. hence this concept is known as pretrained word embeddings. in the case of weights the concept is known as a .,pretrained model
MC,P,1,30,5,30,0,15,400,76,-7752,750,45,but why do we need pretrained word embeddings in the first place? why can’t we learn our own embeddings from scratch? i will answer these questions in the next section.,
MC,H2,1,7,5,7,0,23,600,76,-7643,750,32,why do we need pretrained word embeddings?,
MC,P,4,44,5,44,0,15,400,76,-7591,750,67,pretrained word embeddings capture the semantic and syntactic meaning of a word as they are trained on large datasets. they are capable of boosting the performance of a  model. these word embeddings come in handy during  and of course in real-world problems as well.,natural language processing (nlp)hackathons
MC,P,1,24,5,24,0,15,400,76,-7503,750,45,but why should we not learn our own embeddings? well learning word embeddings from scratch is a challenging problem due to two primary reasons:,
MC,LI,1,4,6,4,0,15,400,116,-7437,710,22,sparsity of training data,
MC,LI,1,5,6,5,0,15,400,116,-7415,710,22,large number of trainable parameters,
MC,STRONG,1,4,6,4,0,15,700,76,-7326,159,18,sparsity of training data,
MC,P,1,40,5,40,0,15,400,76,-7284,750,67,one of the primary reasons for not doing this is the sparsity of training data. most real-world problems contain a dataset that has a . the embeddings learned from these datasets cannot arrive at the right representation of the word.,
MC,P,1,21,5,21,0,15,400,76,-7196,750,45,in order to achieve this the dataset must contain a rich vocabulary. frequently occurring words build just such a rich vocabulary.,
MC,STRONG,1,5,6,5,0,15,700,76,-7085,252,18,large number of trainable parameters,
MC,P,1,37,6,37,0,15,400,76,-7044,750,67,secondly the number of trainable parameters increases while learning embeddings from scratch. this results in a slower training process. learning embeddings from scratch might also leave you in an unclear state about the representation of the words.,
MC,P,1,23,6,23,0,15,400,76,-6955,750,45,so the solution to all the above problems is pretrained word embeddings. let us discuss different pretrained word embeddings in the coming section.,
MC,H2,1,7,6,7,0,23,600,76,-6806,750,32,what are the different pretrained word embeddings?,
MC,P,1,31,5,31,0,15,400,76,-6754,750,67,i would broadly divide the embeddings into 2 classes: .  and  embeddings are examples of character-level embeddings. in this article we are going to cover two popular word-level pretrained word embeddings:,elmoflair
MC,LI,1,2,9,2,1,15,400,116,-6666,710,22,gooogle’s word2vec,
MC,LI,1,2,8,2,1,15,400,116,-6644,710,22,stanford’s glove,
MC,P,1,8,6,8,0,15,400,76,-6600,750,22,let’s understand the working of word2vec and glove.,
MC,H3,1,5,8,5,0,20,600,76,-6513,750,28,google’s word2vec pretrained word embedding,
MC,P,3,40,5,40,0,15,400,76,-6465,750,67,word2vec is one of the most popular pretrained word embeddings developed by google. word2vec is trained on the google news dataset (about 100 billion words). it has several use cases such as  word similarity and different  problems as well.,recommendation enginestext classification
MC,P,1,26,5,26,0,15,400,76,-6377,750,45,the architecture of word2vec is really simple. it’s a feed-forward neural network with just one hidden layer. hence it is sometimes referred to as a .,
MC,P,1,14,6,14,0,15,400,76,-6311,750,22,depending on the way the embeddings are learned word2vec is classified into two approaches:,
MC,LI,1,3,9,3,0,15,400,116,-6268,710,22,continuous bag-of-words (cbow),
MC,LI,1,2,7,2,1,15,400,116,-6246,710,22,skip-gram model,
MC,P,1,26,6,26,0,15,400,76,-6202,750,45,continuous bag-of-words (cbow) model learns the focus word given the neighboring words whereas the skip-gram model learns the neighboring words given the focus word. that’s why:,
MC,P,1,11,5,11,0,18,300,151,-6105,650,26,continous bag of words and skip-gram are inverses of each other.,
MC,P,1,34,5,34,0,15,400,76,-6027,750,45,for example consider the sentence: “i have failed at times but i never stopped trying”.  let’s say we want to learn the embedding of the word “failed”. so here the focus word is “failed”.,
MC,P,1,49,5,49,0,15,400,76,-5961,750,67,a context window refers to the number of words appearing on the left and right of a focus word. the words appearing in the context window are known as neighboring words (or context). let’s fix the context window to 2 and then input and output pairs for both approaches:,
MC,LI,1,11,4,11,0,15,400,116,-5873,710,22,input = [ i have at times ]  output = failed,
MC,LI,1,10,4,10,0,15,400,116,-5851,710,22,input = failed output = [i have at times ],
MC,P,1,32,5,32,0,15,400,76,-5807,750,45,as you can see here cbow accepts multiple words as input and produces a single word as output whereas skip-gram accepts a single word as input and produces multiple words as output.,
MC,P,1,28,4,28,0,15,400,76,-5741,750,45,so let us define the architecture according to the input and output. but keep in mind that each word is fed into a model as a one-hot vector:,
MC,H3,1,5,8,5,0,20,600,76,-5237,750,28,stanford’s glove pretrained word embedding,
MC,P,1,19,5,19,0,18,300,151,-5157,650,53,the basic idea behind the glove word embedding is to derive the relationship between the words from global statistics.,
MC,P,1,9,5,9,0,15,400,76,-5052,750,22,but how can statistics represent meaning? let me explain.,
MC,P,1,12,4,12,0,15,400,76,-5009,750,67,one of the simplest ways is to look at the co-occurrence matrix.,
MC,P,1,24,5,24,0,15,400,76,-4920,750,45,for example consider a corpus: “i play cricket i love cricket and i love football”. the co-occurrence matrix for the corpus looks like this:,
MC,P,1,23,4,23,0,15,400,76,-4604,750,45,now we can easily compute the probabilities of a pair of words. just to keep it simple let’s focus on the word “cricket”:,
MC,P,1,1,17,1,1,15,400,76,-4538,750,22,p(cricket/play)=1,
MC,P,1,1,19,1,1,15,400,76,-4495,750,22,p(cricket/love)=0.5,
MC,P,1,7,6,7,0,15,400,76,-4452,750,22,next let’s compute the ratio of probabilities:,
MC,P,1,5,7,5,0,15,400,76,-4408,750,22,p(cricket/play) / p(cricket/love) = 2,
MC,P,1,36,4,36,0,15,400,76,-4365,750,45,as the ratio > 1 we can infer that the most relevant word to cricket is “play” as compared to “love”. similarly if the ratio is close to 1 then both words are relevant to cricket.,
MC,P,1,22,5,22,0,15,400,76,-4299,750,45,we are able to derive the relationship between the words using simple statistics. this the idea behind the glove pretrained word embedding.,
MC,P,1,26,4,26,0,15,400,76,-4233,750,45,glove learns to encode the information of the probability ratio in the form of word vectors. the most general form of the model is given by:,
MC,H2,1,10,7,10,0,23,600,76,-4006,750,64,case study: learning embeddings from scratch vs. pretrained word embeddings,
MC,P,1,41,5,41,0,15,400,76,-3922,750,67,let’s take a case study to compare the performance of learning our own embeddings from scratch versus pretrained word embeddings. we’ll also aim to understand whether the use of pretrained word embeddings increases the performance of the nlp model or not?,
MC,P,1,20,5,20,0,15,400,76,-3834,750,45,so let’s pick a text classification problem – sentiment analysis on movie reviews. download the movie reviews dataset from .,here

MC,P,1,26,5,26,0,15,400,76,-2810,750,45,we will build two different nlp models of the same architecture. the first model learns embeddings from scratch and the second model uses pretrained word embeddings.,
MC,P,1,8,7,8,0,15,400,76,-2744,750,22,defining the architecture – learning embeddings from scratch:,
MC,P,1,21,6,21,0,15,400,76,-1775,750,45,the total number of trainable parameters in the model is 33889169. out of this the embedding layer contributes to 33661200 parameters.,
MC,P,1,3,6,3,0,15,400,76,-1710,750,22,training the model:,

MC,P,1,21,5,21,0,15,400,76,-1282,750,45,now it’s time to build version ii using glove pretrained word embeddings. let us load the glove embeddings into our environment:,
MC,P,1,5,5,5,0,15,400,76,-902,750,22,: loaded 400000 word vectors.,

MC,P,1,6,8,6,0,15,400,76,-609,750,22,defining the architecture – pretrained embeddings:,
MC,P,1,22,5,22,0,15,400,76,255,750,45,as you can see here the number of trainable parameters is just 227969. that’s a huge drop compared to the embedding layer.,
MC,P,1,3,6,3,0,15,400,76,321,750,22,training the model:,

MC,P,1,34,5,34,0,15,400,76,950,750,45,pretrained word embeddings are the most powerful way of representing a text as they tend to capture the semantic and syntactic meaning of a word. this brings us to the end of the article.,

MC,P,1,6,4,6,0,15,400,76,-13827,750,22,take a look at this image:,
MC,P,1,48,4,48,0,15,400,76,-13327,750,67,what do you think the shape of the curve signifies? as a data scientist (or an aspiring one) you should be able to answer that question at the drop of a hat. the idea behind a bell curve among many other applications is that of a normal distribution.,
MC,P,1,42,6,42,0,15,400,76,-13239,750,67,the normal distribution is a core concept in statistics the backbone of data science. while performing exploratory data analysis we first explore the data and aim to find its probability distribution right? and guess what – the most common probability distribution is,

MC,P,1,33,5,33,0,15,400,76,-12925,750,45,as you can clearly see the birth weight the iq score and stock price return often form a bell-shaped curve. similarly there are many other social and natural datasets that follow normal distribution.,
MC,P,3,29,6,29,0,15,400,76,-12859,750,45,one more reason why normal distribution becomes essential for data scientists is the . this theorem explains the magic of mathematics and is the foundation for hypothesis testing techniques.,central limit theorem

MC,P,1,31,6,31,0,15,400,76,-11586,750,45,one more important phenomena of a normal distribution is that it retains the normal shape throughout unlike other probability distributions that change their properties after a transformation. for a normal distribution:,

MC,LI,1,8,6,8,0,15,400,116,-11497,710,22,of two normal distributions is a normal distribution,

MC,H2,1,5,7,5,0,23,600,76,-11282,750,32,empirical rule for normal distribution,
MC,P,1,23,5,23,0,15,400,76,-11230,750,45,have you heard of the empirical rule? it’s a commonly used concept in statistics (and in a lot of performance reviews as well):,
MC,P,1,8,6,8,0,15,400,76,-10919,750,22,according to the empirical rule for normal distribution:,
MC,LI,1,10,4,10,0,15,400,116,-10875,710,22,of data lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean,
MC,LI,1,10,4,10,0,15,400,116,-10853,710,22,of data lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean,
MC,LI,1,10,4,10,0,15,400,116,-10830,710,22,of data lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean,
MC,P,1,26,4,26,0,15,400,76,-10787,750,45,thus almost all the data lies within . this rule enables us to check for  and is very helpful when determining the normality of any distribution.,
MC,H2,1,6,6,6,0,23,600,76,-10678,750,32,what is a standard normal distribution?,
MC,P,1,26,6,26,0,15,400,76,-10626,750,45,standard normal distribution is a special case of normal distribution when andfor any normal distribution we can convert it into standard normal distribution using the formula:,
MC,P,1,34,6,34,0,15,400,76,-10282,750,67,to understand the importance of converting normal distribution into standard normal distribution  let’s suppose there are two students:ross scored 65 in the exam of paleontology and rachel scored 80 in the fashion designing exam.,
MC,EM,1,9,5,9,0,15,400,76,-10193,362,18,can we conclude that rachel scored better than ross?,
MC,P,1,27,5,27,0,15,400,76,-10151,750,45,no because the way people performed in paleontology may be different from the way people performed in fashion designing. the variability may not be the same here.,
MC,P,1,13,4,13,0,15,400,76,-10085,750,22,so a direct comparison by just looking at the scores will not work.,
MC,P,1,39,5,39,0,15,400,76,-10042,750,67,now let’s say the paleontology marks follow a normal distribution with mean 60 and a standard deviation of 4. on the other hand the fashion designing marks follow a normal distribution with mean 79 and standard deviation of 2.,
MC,P,1,12,6,12,0,15,400,76,-9953,750,22,we will have to calculate the by standardization of both these distributions:,
MC,P,1,26,5,26,0,15,400,76,-9649,750,45,thus ross scored 1.25 standard deviations above the mean score while rachel scored only 0.5 standard deviations above the mean score. hence we can say that,
MC,H2,1,6,6,6,0,23,600,76,-9271,750,32,let’s talk about the skewed distribution,
MC,P,1,45,5,45,0,15,400,76,-9219,750,67,normal distribution is symmetric which means its tails on one side are the mirror image of the other side. but this is not the case with most datasets. generally data points cluster on one side more than the other. we call these types of distributions,
MC,H3,1,3,7,3,0,20,600,76,-9088,750,28,left skewed distribution,
MC,P,1,40,4,40,0,15,400,76,-9040,750,67,when data points cluster on the right side of the distribution then the tail would be longer on the left side. this is the property of . the tail is longer in the negative direction so we also call it,
MC,P,1,2,3,2,1,15,400,76,-8951,750,338,here .,
MC,P,1,27,6,27,0,15,400,76,-8592,750,45,in the normal distribution mean median and mode are equal but in a negatively skewed distribution we express the general relationship between the central tendency measured as:,

MC,P,1,41,4,41,0,15,400,76,-8391,750,67,when data points cluster on the left side of the distribution then the tail would be longer on the right side. this is the property of . here the tail is longer in the positive direction so we also call it,
MC,B,1,8,5,8,0,23,700,76,-7808,488,26,how to check the normality of a distribution,
MC,P,1,34,5,34,0,15,400,76,-7760,750,45,the big question! to check the normality of data let’s take an example where we have the information of the marks of 1000 students for mathematics english and history. you can find the dataset,here.
MC,P,1,16,5,16,0,15,400,76,-7650,750,22,let’s see a few different ways to check the normality of the distribution that we have.,
MC,B,1,1,9,1,1,20,700,76,-7561,99,22,histogram,
MC,LI,1,11,6,11,0,15,400,116,-7516,710,22,a histogram visualizes the distribution of data over a continuous interval,
MC,LI,1,12,6,12,0,15,400,116,-7493,710,22,each bar in a histogram represents the tabulated frequency at each interval/bin,
MC,LI,1,12,6,12,0,15,400,116,-7471,710,22,in simple words height represents the frequency for the respective bin (interval),
MC,B,1,2,4,2,1,20,700,76,-6072,97,22,kde plots,
MC,P,1,34,4,34,0,15,400,76,-6026,750,45,histogram results can vary wildly if you set different numbers of bins or simply change the start and end values of a bin. to overcome this we can make use of the density function.,
MC,P,1,55,5,55,0,15,400,76,-5960,750,90,a density plot is a smoothed continuous version of a histogram estimated from the data. the most common form of estimation is known as. in this method a continuous curve (the kernel) is drawn at every individual data point and all of these curves are then added together to make a single smooth density estimation.,
MC,H3,1,2,4,2,1,20,600,76,-4625,750,28,q_q plot,
MC,P,1,28,6,28,0,15,400,76,-4577,750,45,quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way.,

MC,LI,1,6,4,6,0,15,400,116,-4444,710,22,100 quantile is known as the,
MC,P,1,36,5,36,0,15,400,76,-4160,750,45,10 quantile will divide the normal distribution into 10 parts each having 10 % of the data points. the  or quantile-quantile plot is a scatter plot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another.,
MC,P,1,15,6,15,0,15,400,76,-4094,750,289,here we will plot theoretical normal distribution quantiles and compare them against observed data quantiles:,
MC,P,1,45,4,45,0,15,400,76,-3208,750,90,fo values follow the indicating that they come from a on the other side for larger values are larger as expected from a normal distribution and smaller values are not as small as expected from a normal distribution which is also the case in a,

MC,H3,1,4,5,4,0,20,600,76,-2988,750,28,the concept of skewness,
MC,P,1,27,5,27,0,15,400,76,-2940,750,45,skewness is also another measure to check for normality which tells us the amount and direction of the skewed data points. generally for the value of skewness:,
MC,LI,1,30,4,30,0,15,400,116,-2874,710,45,if the value is we consider the distribution to be  where data points cluster on the right side and the tails are longer on the left side of the distribution,
MC,LI,1,31,4,31,0,15,400,116,-2829,710,67,whereas if the value is  we consider the distribution to be  where data points cluster on the left side and the tails are longer on the right side of the distribution,
MC,LI,1,13,4,13,0,15,400,116,-2762,710,22,and finally if the value is  we consider the distribution to be,
MC,H3,1,3,5,3,0,20,600,76,-2675,750,28,what is kurtosis?,
MC,P,1,24,6,24,0,15,400,76,-2627,750,45,another numerical measure to check for normality is . kurtosis gives the information regarding tailedness which basically indicates the data distribution along the tails.,
MC,P,1,28,5,28,0,15,400,76,-2562,750,45,for the symmetric type of distribution the kurtosis value will be close to zero. we call such types of distributions as its tails are similar to gaussian distribution.,
MC,P,1,69,4,69,0,15,400,76,-2238,750,90,if there are extreme values present in the data then it means that more data points will lie along with the tails. in such cases the value of k will be greater than zero. here tail will be fatter and will have longer distribution. we call such types of distributions as . as we can clearly see here the tails are fatter and denser as compared to gaussian distribution:,
MC,P,1,55,5,55,0,15,400,76,-1851,750,67,if there is a low presence of extreme values compared to normal distribution then lesser data points will lie along the tail. in such cases the kurtosis value will be less than zero. we call such types of distributions as it will have a thinner tail and a shorter distribution in comparison to normal distribution.,
MC,H2,1,2,4,2,1,23,600,76,507,750,32,end notes,
MC,P,1,34,6,34,0,15,400,76,559,750,67,in this article we followed a step by step procedure to understand the fundamentals of normal distribution. we also understood the concepts of determining the normality like histogram kde q_q plot skewness and kurtosis.,

MC,H2,1,10,5,10,0,23,600,76,-9297,750,32,a simple analogy to explain decision tree vs. random forest,
MC,P,1,20,5,20,0,15,400,76,-9245,750,45,let’s start with a thought experiment that will illustrate the difference between a decision tree and a random forest model.,
MC,SPAN,1,49,5,49,0,15,400,76,-9178,726,63,suppose a bank has to approve a small loan amount for a customer and the bank needs to make a decision quickly. the bank checks the person’s credit history and their financial condition and finds that they haven’t re-paid the older loan yet. hence the bank rejects the application.,
MC,SPAN,1,38,4,38,0,15,400,76,-9090,746,41,but here’s the catch – the loan amount was very small for the bank’s immense coffers and they could have easily approved it in a very low-risk move. therefore the bank lost the chance of making some money.,
MC,SPAN,1,65,5,65,0,15,400,76,-9024,750,86,now another loan application comes in a few days down the line but this time the bank comes up with a different strategy – multiple decision-making processes. sometimes it checks for credit history first and sometimes it checks for customer’s financial condition and loan amount first. then the bank combines results from these multiple decision-making processes and decides to give the loan to the customer.,
MC,SPAN,1,17,5,17,0,15,400,76,-8913,631,18,even if this process took more time than the previous one the bank profited using this method.,
MC,SPAN,1,8,5,8,0,15,400,196,-8869,336,18,do you know what these two processes represent?,
MC,SPAN,1,38,5,38,0,15,400,76,-8433,750,63,these are decision trees and a random forest! we’ll explore this idea in detail here dive into the major differences between these two methods and answer the key question – which machine learning algorithm should you go with?,

MC,H2,1,5,6,5,0,23,600,76,-8034,750,32,brief introduction to decision trees,
MC,SPAN,1,48,5,48,0,15,400,76,-7981,731,63,a decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. a decision tree is simply a series of sequential decisions made to reach a specific result. here’s an illustration of a decision tree in action (using our above example):,
MC,P,1,6,5,6,0,15,400,76,-7462,750,22,let’s understand how this tree works.,
MC,P,1,80,5,80,0,15,400,76,-7419,750,112,first it checks if the customer has a good credit history. based on that it classifies the customer into two groups i.e. customers with good credit history and customers with bad credit history. then it checks the income of the customer and again classifies him/her into two groups. finally it checks the loan amount requested by the customer. based on the outcomes from checking these three features the decision tree decides if the customer’s loan should be approved or not.,
MC,P,1,52,5,52,0,15,400,76,-7286,750,67,the features/attributes and conditions can change based on the data and complexity of the problem but the overall idea remains the same. so a decision tree makes a series of decisions based on a set of features/attributes present in the data which in this case were credit history income and loan amount.,
MC,P,1,5,5,5,0,15,400,76,-7198,750,22,now you might be wondering:,
MC,P,1,14,4,14,0,18,300,151,-7123,650,26,why did the decision tree check the credit score first and not the income?,
MC,P,1,52,4,52,0,15,400,76,-7045,750,67,this is known as feature importance and the sequence of attributes to be checked is decided on the basis of criteria like  or the explanation of these concepts is outside the scope of our article here but you can refer to either of the below resources to learn all about decision trees:,
MC,H2,1,5,5,5,0,23,600,76,-6721,750,32,an overview of random forest,
MC,SPAN,1,34,5,34,0,15,400,76,-6667,738,41,the decision tree algorithm is quite easy to understand and interpret. but often a single tree is not sufficient for producing effective results. this is where the random forest algorithm comes into the picture.,
MC,SPAN,1,29,5,29,0,15,400,76,-6361,728,41,random forest is a tree-based machine learning algorithm that leverages the power of multiple decision trees for making decisions. as the name suggests it is a “forest” of trees!,
MC,SPAN,1,50,4,50,0,15,400,76,-6295,736,63,but why do we call it a “random” forest? that’s because it is a forest of . each node in the decision tree works on a random subset of features to calculate the output. the random forest then combines the output of individual decision trees to generate the final output.,
MC,SPAN,1,3,5,3,0,15,400,76,-6207,109,18,in simple words:,
MC,P,1,18,6,18,0,18,300,151,-6134,650,53,the random forest algorithm combines the output of multiple (randomly created) decision trees to generate the final output.,
MC,P,1,40,5,40,0,15,400,76,-5507,750,67,this process of combining the output of multiple individual models (also known as weak learners) is called . if you want to read more about how the random forest and other ensemble learning algorithms work check out the following articles:,
MC,SPAN,1,31,5,31,0,15,400,76,-5306,703,41,now the question is how can we decide which algorithm to choose between a decision tree and a random forest? let’s see them both in action before we make any conclusions!,

MC,SPAN,1,40,5,40,0,15,400,76,-5145,743,41,in this section we will be using python to solve a binary classification problem using both a decision tree as well as a random forest. we will then compare their results and see which one suited our problem the best.,

MC,H3,1,7,5,7,0,20,600,76,-4840,750,28,step 1: loading the libraries and dataset,
MC,SPAN,1,11,6,11,0,15,400,76,-4790,455,18,let’s start by importing the required python libraries and our dataset:,
MC,SPAN,1,36,5,36,0,15,400,76,-4380,741,41,the dataset consists of 614 rows and 13 features including credit history marital status loan amount and gender. here the target variable is  which indicates whether a person should be given a loan or not.,

MC,SPAN,2,22,5,22,0,15,400,76,-4134,748,41,also we will be label encoding the categorical values in the data. you can read this article for learning more about .,label encoding
MC,H3,1,7,4,7,0,20,600,76,-3433,750,28,step 3: creating train and test sets,

MC,P,1,14,4,14,0,15,400,76,-3222,750,22,let’s take a look at the shape of the created train and test sets:,
MC,DIV,1,19,5,19,0,15,400,76,-2922,750,22,great! now we are ready for the next stage where we’ll build the decision tree and random forest models!,
MC,H3,1,7,5,7,0,20,600,76,-2880,750,28,step 4: building and evaluating the model,
MC,SPAN,1,30,5,30,0,15,400,76,-2830,735,41,since we have both the training and testing sets it’s time to train our models and classify the loan applications. first we will train a decision tree on this dataset:,
MC,P,1,21,5,21,0,15,400,76,-2603,750,45,next we will evaluate this model using f1-score. f1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall given by the formula:,
MC,SPAN,1,11,5,11,0,15,400,76,-2379,423,18,let’s evaluate the performance of our model using the f1 score:,
MC,SPAN,1,44,5,44,0,15,400,76,-1984,742,63,here you can see that the decision tree performs well on in-sample evaluation but its performance decreases drastically on out-of-sample evaluation. why do you think that’s the case? unfortunately our decision tree model is  on the training data. will random forest solve this issue?,overfitting
MC,H3,1,5,5,5,0,20,600,76,-1854,750,28,building a random forest model,
MC,P,1,8,4,8,0,15,400,76,-1806,750,22,let’s see a random forest model in action:,
MC,SPAN,1,31,5,31,0,15,400,76,-1289,733,41,here we can clearly see that the random forest model performed much better than the decision tree in the out-of-sample evaluation. let’s discuss the reasons behind this in the next section.,
MC,STRONG,1,10,5,10,0,23,700,76,-1138,731,26,why did our random forest model outperform the decision tree?,
MC,SPAN,1,37,5,37,0,15,400,76,-1088,748,63,random forest leverages the power of multiple decision trees. it does  rely on the feature importance given by a single decision tree. let’s take a look at the feature importance given by different algorithms to different features:,
MC,SPAN,1,63,5,63,0,15,400,76,-308,725,86,as you can clearly see in the above graph the decision tree model gives high importance to a particular set of features. but the random forest chooses features randomly during the training process. therefore it does not depend highly on any specific set of features. this is a special characteristic of random forest over bagging trees. you can read more about the bagg,

MC,SPAN,1,27,5,27,0,15,400,76,-197,714,41,therefore the random forest can generalize over the data in a better way. this randomized feature selection makes random forest much more accurate than a decision tree.,
MC,STRONG,1,12,4,12,0,23,700,76,-86,682,58,so which one should you choose – decision tree or random forest?,
MC,SPAN,1,19,5,19,0,18,400,151,29,608,47,random forest is suitable for situations when we have a large dataset and interpretability is not a major concern.,
MC,P,1,7,4,7,0,15,400,76,131,750,67,here is an article that talks about,
MC,SPAN,1,36,5,36,0,15,400,76,133,730,63,decision trees are much easier to interpret and understand. since a random forest combines multiple decision trees it becomes more difficult to interpret. here’s the good news – it’s not impossible to interpret a random forest.,
MC,SPAN,1,58,5,58,0,15,400,76,265,729,86,also random forest has a higher training time than a single decision tree. you should take this into consideration because as we increase the number of trees in a random forest the time taken to train each of them also increases. that can often be crucial when you’re working with a tight deadline in a machine learning project.,
MC,SPAN,1,49,5,49,0,15,400,76,375,739,63,but i will say this – despite instability and dependency on a particular set of features decision trees are really helpful because they are easier to interpret and faster to train. anyone with very little knowledge of data science can also use decision trees to make quick data-driven decisions.,
MC,H2,1,2,4,2,1,23,600,76,545,750,32,end notes,
MC,P,1,39,5,39,0,15,400,76,597,750,45,that is essentially what you need to know in the decision tree vs. random forest debate. it can get tricky when you’re new to machine learning but this article should have cleared up the differences and similarities for you.,

MC,P,1,31,4,31,0,18,400,161,-5863,810,56,the good news is you don’t need to know what everything does just yet and the easiest way to learn is to learn each button and option as you encounter it.,
MC,P,1,79,4,79,0,18,400,161,-5330,810,140,let’s start with the absolute basics. the source code is on your right in the largest window. whichever file you’ve selected will be what shows here. just above the window there is a tab which will likely say . this means the file you’re looking at and editing is the  file which loads by default when your app runs unless you chose a different name for it right at the start. above that is the route of the file:,

MC,P,1,44,4,44,0,18,400,161,-4890,810,84,finally down at the bottom you will have another window where you can see messages a terminal an android monitor and more. the window may be minimized at the moment but if you click on any of these bottom options it will pop up.,

MC,P,3,63,4,63,0,18,400,161,-4547,810,112,of course along the top you also have your menu. there’s far more here than you need to worry about for now. for now you’ll just want to save your app from time to time in the file menu and use “run” to test your app. in future you’ll use other menus like tools for more advanced tasks like creating virtual devices or .,updating the sdk

MC,P,2,70,5,70,0,18,400,161,-4355,810,112,what confused me most when i started learning how to use android studio was the range of different files that made up a single app. if you have any background in other types of programming you might be used to creating a single file and then hitting “run” to test it out. here though we have our activities layout files resource files manifest and . it’s all a bit confusing.,gradle scripts
MC,P,1,13,4,13,0,18,400,161,-4222,810,28,if we break it down it doesn’t have to be quite so intimidating.,
MC,P,1,63,5,63,0,18,400,161,-4173,810,112,provides the bulk of your code to start (as mentioned you did have the option to change this when creating your new app project). this is the code for the first activity: the first screen of your app. it handles the logic of button presses and is where you’ll write code to handle specific functions like if you want to make the phone vibrate.,
MC,P,1,23,5,23,0,18,400,161,-3663,810,56,this will normally already be open when you start your new project. otherwise you’ll find it in the left window by navigating here:,

MC,P,1,16,5,16,0,18,400,161,-3537,810,28,knowing how to find and open up files like this is crucial to understanding android studio.,
MC,P,1,38,4,38,0,18,400,161,-3488,810,84,the second important part of the app is the  file. this is the layout file meaning it will handle the design and the appearance of your app. it’s where we’ll add buttons for instance. you’ll find it under:,
MC,STRONG,1,7,5,7,0,18,700,161,-3380,292,22,app > res > layout > activity_main.xml,
MC,P,1,15,4,15,0,18,400,161,-3334,810,28,if you have another look at  you’ll notice there’s a line that says this:,
MC,P,1,59,4,59,0,18,400,161,-3183,810,112,this tells us the appearance for that activity is located in  and is called . we could change this to any other xml file if we wished. so  handles the appearance of our app and  provides the logic. the two files combine to form our activity. to make additional activities (screens) normally we’d want an additional one of each.,
MC,P,1,14,5,14,0,18,400,161,-3050,810,28,when editing the xml files you’ll notice they are formatted differently from java files:,
MC,P,1,54,4,54,0,18,400,161,-2465,810,84,notice the tabs at the bottom that let you toggle between a design and text view. this lets you drag and drop views (elements like buttons and text boxes) wherever you want them in the layout. learning how to use android studio’s design view will save you a lot of time typing up xml.,
MC,H2,1,3,5,3,0,32,500,161,-1840,810,44,more useful files,
MC,P,1,30,4,30,0,18,400,161,-1781,810,56,also in the  directory is a folder called . this is where you’ll place any images you want to reference later on. in “values” you have some more xml files:,

MC,P,2,60,5,60,0,18,400,161,-1610,810,112,these store values for your colors and text the that will populate your apps among other things. you can reference them from any other application. the mipmap folder is where you’ll put the icon for your image. note that resource files can’t include spaces or capitals which is why they use underscores instead of  (where capital letters start each word).,camel case
MC,P,1,5,5,5,0,18,400,161,-1477,810,28,this is another important file:,

MC,P,1,31,5,31,0,18,400,161,-1379,810,56,this contains crucial information about your app. it’s where you can change things like your app’s name the version of android you want to target and the permissions it will require.,
MC,P,1,81,5,81,0,18,400,161,-785,810,140,finally gradle is a “build automation system.” this indexes all the files in your app and builds that final apk when you’re ready to run or distribute your app. it’s also where you will add “dependencies” which means you can use libraries with additional functionality for your code. you can pretty much just leave gradle to do its thing 90 percent of the time. if you find notes that say things like “gradle build finished”  now you know what it means.,
MC,P,1,37,4,37,0,18,400,161,-624,810,56,every now and then gradle can get a little confused and fail to update all the files in your app. if your app refuses to run when really it should try selecting this will solve the problem:,

MC,P,1,42,5,42,0,18,400,161,-3009,810,112,as a long-time google play music subscriber it definitely seems to me like google is being way too hasty at best and making a huge mistake at worst. and that’s mainly because google play music and youtube music reflect two different philosophies.,
MC,P,1,16,5,16,0,18,400,161,-2876,810,56,put bluntly: youtube music isn’t a music app it’s a way to increase youtube viewing minutes.,

MC,P,2,25,4,25,0,18,400,161,-2284,810,56,let’s run through just a few of the ways youtube music fails as a  and  rival and more crucially as a google play music replacement.,spotifyapple music
MC,P,1,63,5,63,0,18,400,161,-2187,810,112,for starters google hasn’t implemented the ability to fully disable autoplay functionality almost two years after its launch. this is possible for playlists but what if you want to listen to a single track? then you’ll need to create a playlist solely for that track. you can disable autoplay if you want to watch a single video on  but not youtube music.,youtube
MC,P,1,82,5,82,0,18,400,161,-2005,810,168,the anointed music service also doesn’t acknowledge that music and video recommendations and subscriptions aren’t necessarily the same thing. sure you might watch a funny music video or listen to an eclectic track on youtube but do you really want it affecting your recommendations in a music streaming app? this then leads to a scenario where people second-guess whether they should like videos on youtube or subscribe to a channel due to the potential effect it will have on their music experience.,
MC,P,1,56,5,56,0,18,400,161,-1816,810,112,google has improved youtube music’s offline capabilities but it’s still a long way from matching google play music’s offline mode. here play music adopts an app-wide offline mode with the various app screens showing your offline content. but youtube music is content to simply direct you to your downloads page with other tabs rendered mostly useless.,
MC,P,1,19,4,19,0,34,400,163,-1638,808,113,it seems like youtube music was made to keep people on youtube first and as a music player second.,
MC,P,1,46,6,46,0,18,400,161,-1473,810,112,youtube music does offer smart downloads (automatically downloading your favorite content) and the ability to download a “liked” playlist. but this definitely pales in comparison to google play music’s functionality offering automatic playlists (e.g. last added thumbs up purchased) and the ability to cache while streaming.,
MC,P,6,44,5,44,0,18,400,161,-1340,810,84,sure many of these gimped or missing features might not be intentional. it’s also great that the  feature is finally coming to youtube music as outside of  play music was one of the only ways that avid collectors can stream their private collections.,music lockerclient-server streaming platforms like plex
MC,P,1,21,6,21,0,18,400,161,-1235,810,56,however all of the aforementioned lacking or intrusive features illustrate the gulf in how google views play music versus youtube music.,
MC,H2,1,5,4,5,0,32,500,161,-1158,810,44,a move to benefit youtube,
MC,P,1,51,5,51,0,18,400,161,-644,810,112,the search giant’s decision to simply kill off google play music in favor of youtube music isn’t a surprise given the company’s reported obsession with engagement at any cost. roughly a year ago   that youtube employees were told not to “rock the boat” after they raised concerns about toxic video recommendations.,reported
MC,P,1,60,5,60,0,18,400,161,-511,810,112,in fact one computer scientist interviewed by the outlet says he told youtube that their recommendation engine was an “addiction engine.” the scientist felt that google didn’t express any desire to change this system. this only serves as more evidence that google is perhaps willing to do almost anything for youtube engagement so why not kill a beloved app too?,
MC,P,5,38,5,38,0,18,400,161,-260,810,84,google could’ve simply rebranded google play music to youtube music instead or considering google’s recent attempts to bring all of its services back under the google name with   and the  why not just google music?,nestandroid payrumored android tv rebrand
MC,P,1,31,6,31,0,18,400,161,-155,810,84,it’s not like play music didn’t already have youtube video integration either. you’d think that deeper yet more thoughtful integration of youtube’s vast library would’ve been possible without such drastic measures.,
MC,P,3,36,5,36,0,18,400,161,-50,810,84,between google killing a perfectly good app and its quest for higher youtube engagement figures it’s a good thing that there are  for those that want more “music” and less “youtube” from their music streaming apps.,plenty of alternatives

MC,P,4,59,5,59,0,18,400,161,-2848,810,168, security researchers gabriel cirlig and andrew tierney claimed that xiaomi’s web browsers collect an inordinate amount of data even in . this allegedly included all urls and search queries made in the stock miui browser as well as mi browser pro and mint browser. combined these browsers have more than 15 million downloads on the google play store.,speaking to forbesincognito mode

MC,P,2,86,5,86,0,18,400,161,-2096,810,168,it’s true that  has become so rampant nowadays many people simply take it as a fact of life. however lines need to be drawn in the sand and with these credible claims xiaomi seems to have crossed them. what is most concerning about the findings is that according to cirlig the company uses unique numbers which identify devices and therefore users. according to  “the device was also recording what folders he opened and to which screens he swiped including the status bar and the settings page.”,data collection
MC,P,3,86,5,86,0,18,400,161,-1887,810,168,xiaomi  in an effort to refute the claims stating that they are “misrepresentative of the facts.” tierney later followed up on xiaomi’s blog post with a  defending the original findings with further evidence. in said blog post the chinese manufacturer claimed all collected data is anonymized and that its practices are no different from the industry standard. however actions speak louder than words. not long after issuing the statement xiaomi pushed an update to its browsers allowing users to toggle off data collection in incognito mode.,responded quicklytwitter thread
MC,P,1,64,5,64,0,18,400,161,-1649,810,112,so problem solved right? wrong! adding a toggle off option seems like a weak attempt to placate users. it does not address the core issue either. why is xiaomi collecting all this data in the first place if your “privacy and security are of top priority?” exact urls and search queries are not telemetry or usage statistics necessary for the maintenance of its products.,
MC,H2,1,6,4,6,0,32,500,161,-1516,810,44,you do have something to hide,
MC,P,2,81,5,81,0,18,400,161,-1001,810,168,don’t think you have nothing to hide either. think of every embarrassing incognito hypochondriac search on webmd every silly question you’ve typed into google every piece of adult content you’ve watched on your phone in incognito mode — are you really comfortable with a company having this data if you are not comfortable enough having a record of it on your device? even if we assume no malicious intent on xiaomi’s side  are common and sensitive information could end up anywhere.,data breaches
MC,P,2,75,5,75,0,18,400,161,-812,810,140,xiaomi claims all data it collects is anonymized although this has been disputed by the findings of the security researchers. yet even if we take xiaomi’s side in this argument there has been evidence that some anonymized data can still be linked to users.   with anonymous location data. while browser information might be harder to link to a person than location data it could be possible depending on how the data is collected and stored.,proved this
MC,P,1,66,5,66,0,18,400,161,-602,810,112,i also take issue with xiaomi essentially saying that they are doing what everyone else does. it’s a poor excuse and textbook example of whataboutism. companies have a vested interest in establishing a lower status quo for privacy so they can harvest more precious data from consumers. with no consequences for their actions the more we’re likely to see more invasive data collection in the future.,
MC,P,6,73,5,73,0,18,400,161,-469,810,140,in xiaomi’s case the addition of the toggle off option is also frustrating because this means the default hasn’t changed. the chinese company will keep collecting incognito browser data unless users are aware of the toggle and explicitly opt-out. this means that for the average user that’s not particularly tech-savvy the status quo hasn’t changed. given the fact that xiaomi is the  this will likely be the case for millions of users.,fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer by market share
MC,H2,1,11,5,11,0,32,500,161,-308,810,88,is selling your privacy worth it just for a discounted product?,
MC,P,1,80,5,80,0,18,400,161,-205,810,140,i know that many will chime in with the inevitable answer “just change your browser.” while that’s a totally reasonable suggestion and probably something you should do it does not let xiaomi off the hook. the company already collects data for targeted advertising. in fact xiaomi often calls itself an internet company that happens to sell hardware because most of its revenue is derived from services and ads. yet ultimately this means that you and your data are the product.,
MC,P,1,51,5,51,0,18,400,161,74,810,84,so when it is revealed that even incognito mode is not safe from harvesting it begs the question: where does it end? is getting a good smartphone bargain really worth your online privacy? in my view it’s time to reevaluate how valuable our data is and to start holding companies accountable.,

MC,P,1,3,4,3,0,16,400,223,-6096,760,22,“and my pick!”,
MC,P,1,5,4,5,0,14,400,825,-6089,158,19,13th may 2020 / 2:00pm,
MC,P,1,141,4,141,0,16,400,258,-5606,690,336,i have seven seconds to bypass twenty feet of sheer rock face to reach a subterranean escape pod before it propels itself back up through the planet’s surface leaving my dwarven engineer trapped in a network of dark tunnels teeming with screeching alien insects. after a seeming eternity of desperate scrambling i’ve made it to the cavern containing the escape pod my heart  sinking as i see how high up it is. my platform-creating gun has a single shot left and i’ve nowhere near enough time to dig my way up. it’s then i spot it: a geyser venting trails of steam that can propel my dwarf into the air. i take the punt. it lifts me halfway up. my final desperate platform shot does the rest. i leave with a shiny haul of gems and roughly two seconds to spare.,
MC,P,3,53,4,53,0,16,400,258,-5247,690,90,the high level concept for this game is  meets  both undeniably influential games that personally i don’t have much enthusiasm for. let me tell you why deep rock galactic – a game that the phrase ‘more than the sum of its parts’ could have been invented for – is an absolute gem.,left 4 deadminecraft
MC,P,1,145,5,145,0,16,400,258,-5135,690,224,that desperate rush i described above was the exfiltration phase. you’ve explored the tunnels fought back the giant bugs trying to stop you. you’ve mined the requisite minerals or stolen some alien eggs for research or slain a few giant bosses. now your team have five minutes to make it back to the escape pod – back through the complicated web of tunnels and ziplines and platforms you’ve laid out – before it leaves without you failing the  menagerie of skittering xenobugs previously scattered about the caves or attacking in telegraphed waves are now a constant aggressive threat. more challenging still these caves can look very different when you’re de-lunking back up the same route you just spelunked down. with nary an eagle in sight you’d better hope that at least one of your team of diminutive explorers gave some thought to the return journey.,
MC,P,1,148,5,148,0,16,400,258,-4418,690,224,i’m making it sound more complicated than it is here but the sense of dramatics is fully to the game’s credit. exfiltration always feels tense and exciting even when it isn’t all that challenging. expeditions usually run around 15 to 25 minutes and though you’ll get a small experience bonus even if no dwarf makes it out you’ll still lose most of the rewards. between missions you’ll return to a colorful tactile hub area that lets you spend that experience money and any rare minerals you mined on perks cosmetics and equipment upgrades. there’s two experience levels in total: a cumulative rank for you as a player and individual ranks for each of the four classes both with their own set of unlocks. failing to make the exfiltration run always feels like enough of a loss to keep things tense. plus no dwarf wants to lose their shinies.,
MC,P,1,92,5,92,0,16,400,258,-4171,690,134,before you cave dive you’ll be able to pick one of four classes. the gunner packs a beefy gatling that takes a moment to warm up and can overheat if you push it too hard but also dishes out beaucoup hurt on bugs and can be upgraded to stun thinning and stalling an encroaching tide. he can also shoot ziplines that can be traversed both ways making them great for dangerous drops and unreachable nooks. plus he can throw down shield generators for the team to huddle inside during especially intense fights.,
MC,P,1,75,5,75,0,16,400,258,-4014,690,112,the engineer has automated sentry turrets a grenade launcher and a shotgun. rushing to set up those sentries as soon as you get the heads up from mission control that a swarm is approaching is every bit the thrilling aliens homage it should be right down to the steadily draining ammo counters. he can also shoot platforms creating staircases and walkways for navigation and can throw bug-distracting lures to give the team some breathing room.,
MC,P,1,106,5,106,0,16,400,258,-3409,690,157,all dwarves can use their pickaxes to mine through any surface but the driller has a giant drill on each arm which lets him bore huge tunnels in seconds. he also has a flamethrower satchel charges and some classic dwarven throwing axes. i will not dwell too long on the merits of cleaning out giant insects with a flamethrower because it is obviously very good. finally there’s the scout whose flare gun can illuminate areas much more effectively than the standard flares all dwarves have access to and also has a grappling hook. he’s no slouch in a scrap either packing a sawn-off and assault rifle.,
MC,P,1,120,5,120,0,16,400,258,-3230,690,179,with the exception of the driller whose initial fuel reserve felt too low to constantly rely on for difficult navigation each class is both viable and enjoyable to run missions solo with. still it’s teamwork where deep rock galactic shines brighter than a rich mineral vein. co-op is seamless so you can either get a team together from friends start a mission solo and wait for others to drop in (which is almost always the community seems very active) or a combination of both. you can also run missions solo if you so choose. oh and you’re not limited to one of each class so if you want four engineers laying down a wall of sentry guns go for it.,
MC,P,1,70,5,70,0,16,400,258,-3028,690,112,you’ll be able to view the cave complexity and length of each mission before you begin but the proc-gen is generally quite adept at providing a constant stream of novel cave layouts. although each class has a role in fights it’s how they compliment each other during these procedural navigation puzzles that leads to loads of lovely micro-instances of cooperation all contributing to the overall feeling of back-slapping dwarven camaraderie.,
MC,P,1,83,4,83,0,16,400,258,-2442,690,112,need some light in this tunnel? i got you. just thrown out two sentry guns and need someone to set up the second? i got you. i’m playing as the driller and i’ve just spotted a tasty vein of rare upgrade minerals at the top of this vast cavern so i’m going to tag it with my scanner the engineer is going to create a makeshift ledge beneath it then the scout can grapple up and get to work. we got each other.,
MC,P,1,80,5,80,0,16,400,258,-2307,690,134,you can of course just dig anywhere with your pickaxe no matter which class you pick. you can make endless staircases winding through the faces of sheer cliffs or make fatal drops trivial. once you get the hang of it it offers a mastery over the harsh and unknown environments that’s nothing short of intoxicating. it’s all the impossible freedom of possessing a set of wings minus the wings themselves with dwarven ingenuity stubborness and resolve in lieu of gracefulness.,
MC,P,1,106,4,106,0,16,400,258,-2150,690,157,but it’s always more efficient to work together and it’s a lot more fun to boot. there is precisely one emote in the game pressing ‘v’ to hold your pickaxe high and shout some variation of “rock and stone!”. you greet strangers with it when they drop into your mission in-progress and they greet you back. everyone does it before or after a tough fight or when descending in the pod at the start of the mission or reaching the escape pod at the end. you will both hear it and perform it dozens of times every time you play and it never stops being brilliant.,
MC,P,1,58,5,58,0,16,400,258,-1500,690,90,that one salute is emblematic of how so many of the game’s small details add up to something special. the extra uses you’ll find for your navigation tools like flanking bugs to shoot their glowing thoraxes for increased damage. the way exploding bugs blow huge holes in the environment so that once-stable platforms can suddenly become death traps.,
MC,P,1,67,5,67,0,16,400,258,-1388,690,90,and the dwarfiness of it all too. guns and explosions can deal friendly fire but pickaxes don’t. sometimes you’ll find a giant larvae called a ‘loot bug’ that you can bludgeon until it splatters out gems. i love the loot bug because i love the idea of the mining dwarves discovering their first loot bug finding out what it does then canonically naming it a ‘loot bug’.,
MC,P,1,69,6,69,0,16,400,258,-1276,690,134,the interplay between constructables and a fully destructible environment along with that reactive fuzziness that comes from colliding physics systems contribute to the feeling that these environments are places to play in too rather than just levels to play through. there’s a singular feeling somewhere between stifling claustrophobia and exploratory wonder imparted by these labyrinthine caves. vast and intimidating yet host to wondrous effervescent flora and impossible alien biomes.,
MC,P,1,67,5,67,0,16,400,258,-667,690,112,most enemies make great use of the vertical space afforded to them in their giant rock halls. if something can’t fly it can usually crawl across walls and down stalactites to ambush you. there’s enough disgusting insectoid variety on show that it feels like these species have evolved over millennia in a biological arms race with the meddlesome longbeards that won’t stop nicking all their best rocks.,
MC,P,1,130,5,130,0,16,400,258,-533,690,202,as pernicious an antagonist as the bugs is the capitalist greed that permeates the mining operation. the escape pod won’t even open until the m.u.l.e robot that carries the minerals is safely on board. for management it’s rocks first dwarves second even if your escape pod has ‘no dwarf left behind’ embossed on the floor. in drg you don’t feel like you have to grind to get to the good bits while still feeling rewarded for progress which feels a tad pat as an observation. but it’s true and it plays into deep rock galactic’s relationship with its systems: acquisition repetitiveness reward cycles progress. there’s satire but there’s also the recognition that well you’re dwarves after all. nothing makes your bearded brothers happier than hitting glittering minerals with a pickaxe.,
MC,P,1,97,5,97,0,16,400,258,-309,690,157,this is brought further to the forefront by the fact that deep rock galactic has all the multiple resources cosmetic unlocks upgrades and victory poses you’d expect from some of gaming’s most heinously manipulative microtransaction farms but has no microtransactions. there’s a ‘supporter pack’ available for 12 quid – half of the base game’s price – but it’s all cosmetic items. call me a rube but it genuinely seems like what it says on the tin: an optional buy for especially dedicated fans who wish to support a first time developer through a lengthy early access period.,
MC,P,1,93,4,93,0,16,400,258,342,690,134,“this is fun” the scout shouts mining the same mineral he has a thousand times before. it’s that same cycle of compulsive busywork and sugary serotonin rewards that would seem cynical in a lesser game but is given enough context by what surrounds it to make it feel considered. i’m not sure i want hitting gems with a pickaxe over and over again to feel as satisfying as it does but i can’t blame the game for that and i certainly can’t accuse it of not making me feel like i’m in character.,
MC,P,1,101,5,101,0,16,400,258,499,690,157,i could criticise the procgen for occasionally churning out some obnoxiously complex levels but this is part and parcel with so much of what makes them interesting. i could also hope for a bit more variety in mission objectives but there’s so much of it available in approach that it does little to dampen the experience. i’m also not convinced all classes are created equal with the engineer feeling like the best solid all round option to the other three situational classes and the driller gifted the neatest looking toys in consideration of the fact that he’s a bit useless actually.,
MC,P,1,42,5,42,0,16,400,258,678,690,67,that said it’s a winner. sixteen tons of detail sixteen tons of character sixteen tons of riotous bug blasting spelunking co-operative goodness. deep rock galactic is a company i’ve got no qualms about selling my soul to for hours more to come.,
MC,H1,1,9,6,9,0,24,700,223,-6397,760,34,amazon's crucible is a refreshing take on the hero shooter,
MC,P,1,5,4,5,0,14,400,826,-6356,158,19,19th may 2020 / 2:05pm,
MC,P,9,86,5,86,0,16,400,258,-5873,690,134,it was only a matter of time before amazon properly jumped into the gaming space and here we are with . developed by amazon’s relentless studios  is a new free-to-play third-person shooter. i’ll be the first to admit that those words put me off at first it’s not easy for these sorts of games to stand out amongst the rest. but having seen some gameplay firsthand and had a chat with the developers i’m actually really excited about crucible and what it’s bringing to the table.,their very own multiplayer hero shooter coming out tomorrowcrucible
MC,P,1,124,5,124,0,16,400,258,-5716,690,179,so first things first what are we actually going to see tomorrow? well in crucible players are plopped on a planet to complete various objectives against enemy teams. what we’re in for seems like a weird amalgamation of moba-style strategy mixed in with third-person combat. it’s not the sort of hero shooter where you constantly need to be with your team – it’s the opposite most of the time actually. most matches there’ll be loads of times where you just venture off on your own killing computer enemies to level yourself up. you need to level up you see to increase things like your health pool and damage output so you’re prepared for when you do get in a team fight over an objective.,
MC,P,1,44,5,44,0,16,400,258,-5515,690,67,and these objectives change from mode to mode. heart of the hives for example puts you in two teams of four competing to collect hearts – which as you might have guessed from the name you get by taking down big structures called hives.,
MC,P,1,102,4,102,0,16,400,258,-4980,690,134,next up is the last-man-standing mode alpha hunters. this one is essentially relentless’ take on the battle royale chucking eight teams of two onto the planet of crucible while the map slowly zones you in. there’s a cool twist to this one though. as you play in pairs if your partner gets eliminated you can temporarily form a new team with another player who’s also been widowed. if you get to the final two this alliance will have to break down of course but it gives you a better chance of getting to the end than you would have on your own.,
MC,P,1,55,4,55,0,16,400,258,-4379,690,90,lastly we have harvester command. this is your typical “hold the most control zones to rack up points” kinda mode. it’s 8v8 with five harvesters to take control of which leads to a whole lot of fighting all across the map. i think i’m most excited for this one purely for how hectic it looks.,
MC,P,1,68,5,68,0,16,400,258,-3823,690,112,these are the only three game modes we can expect at launch but from the sounds of things there might be more added a little later down the line. the developers will be rolling out content updates seasonally with plans to release “at least one really exciting new feature or gameplay experience” each season too (which could be anything from a new hunter to a new game mode).,
MC,P,1,57,4,57,0,16,400,258,-3688,690,90,when the game comes out tomorrow it’ll start in its preseason which will run for eight weeks followed by the proper first season after that. normally seasons will run for about 10 weeks and as we’ve all come to expect now each will come with a new battle pass and set of rewards for players to earn.,
MC,P,1,42,5,42,0,16,400,258,-3576,690,67,relentless mention that while they already have some post launch plans they’ll be keeping an eye on the game’s community to see what players want. they’ll be doing smaller patches every two weeks to address things like bugs and game balance too.,
MC,P,1,79,5,79,0,16,400,258,-3487,690,112,“one of the biggest things with this type of online game and this type of experience is that we’re asking a lot of the players to invest in this game” they said. “when you do that i think it’s really important that players feel like the game is constantly getting better that there’s a really open communication channel with a developer team in a sense that everyone’s in it together and that the game is always evolving and improving.”,
MC,P,1,65,5,65,0,16,400,258,-2900,690,90,for some players (let’s be honest i mean players like myself) one of the quickest things to get invested in will be the characters. in crucible they’re called hunters and there’ll be 10 of them at launch. they’re all designed to be effective by themselves without the backing of a whole team – as mentioned before they’re gonna be on their own a fair bit.,
MC,P,1,49,5,49,0,16,400,258,-2788,690,67,“the first thing we set out to do regardless of game mode was to make characters that felt as dynamic as any other hero games from mobas to you know overwatch and other hero shooters. but at the same time to create characters that are so self-reliant” they said.,
MC,P,1,66,5,66,0,16,400,258,-2698,690,90,“in the team modes it makes our combat a little bit more dynamic because people can do all the different things and all the different roles for your team. i think that’s a really important thing because it allows players to choose the character that they love and for the other people playing with them to work with that choice because all of it goes together.”,
MC,P,1,68,5,68,0,16,400,258,-2586,690,112,each character does still have a kind of role to play – some are more suited to long and mid-range combat while others are designed for more close quarters brawling. i’m a big fan of this spiky lad with the giant axe. he’s one of the melee-focused characters and watching him absolutely charge at you is quite terrifying. reminds me a bit of the krogan from mass effect.,
MC,P,1,31,5,31,0,16,400,258,-2041,690,45,there’s a pretty diverse set of aliens humans and robots for players to choose from and having so much variation was a pretty important factor for the devs from the outset.,
MC,P,1,62,5,62,0,16,400,258,-1974,690,112,“there are gameplay benefits to that when you talk about things like diversity and uniqueness in terms of silhouette” they say. “we want it to be something that whenever you’re watching your friends play or your favorite streamer play we want you to be able to quickly filter and understand what’s happening at any time or distance and who the characters are.,
MC,P,1,70,5,70,0,16,400,258,-1840,690,112,“but in addition to the gameplay side of it diversity was super important to us about creating characters that would give players someone that they can truly connect to – whether it’s diversity in their abilities and the way they play the game or diversity and gender race ethnicity body type personality. we wanted to make sure that for anybody who plays this game we’ve created a hunter for them.”,
MC,P,1,19,5,19,0,16,400,258,-1295,690,45,relentless went as far as to make sure the voices for their characters were as genuine as possible too.,
MC,P,1,36,5,36,0,16,400,258,-1228,690,67,“we really valued authenticity when it came to casting. we have a lot of characters of colour and various genders and we wanted to be sure to cast actors and actresses that match their characters. “,
MC,P,1,33,5,33,0,16,400,258,-1138,690,45,they did lose me a little on the follow up to this however because instead of telling us about these authentic characters of colour they talked about the casting for bugg the robot.,
MC,P,1,82,4,82,0,16,400,258,-1071,690,112,“bugg’s actor is a real robot” they told us. “we actually sent out a lot of auditions. we did our same audition process for bugg that we did with all of our characters. we got adults children men women you know all auditioning for this character and in the end we decided that the amazon poly voice that we had been using for prototyping had more character than any of them so we ended up just sticking with it ’til the end.”,
MC,P,1,24,4,24,0,16,400,258,-936,690,45,cool. so uh sorry to all the voice actors that went for the role of bugg you lost that job to a literal robot.,
MC,P,1,78,5,78,0,16,400,258,-417,690,112,as with other live service games like apex legends and warframe i’m told that crucible will have some sort of underlying narrative to add a bit of flavour to the world. the developers understand that not every player cares about that sort of thing and they don’t want to upstage the gameplay. but for players who are interested in the story of crucible narrative designer samantha vick tells me there are plenty of clues to go looking for.,
MC,P,1,46,5,46,0,16,400,258,-283,690,90,“we’ve peppered our map with environmental narrative elements that hint at the planet’s past and future” she said. “there are a lot of interesting things to discover and we’ve already got alpha players hunting down clues and comparing notes trying to piece together their own theories.”,
MC,P,1,41,5,41,0,16,400,258,-171,690,67,similarly to overwatch characters will have downtime conversations during matches giving players an idea of how they get on with each other. on top of that each character has a first-person monologue that can be unlocked piece-by-piece as you play them.,
MC,P,1,80,5,80,0,16,400,258,-81,690,112,“they’re unlocked at the end of a match same as other types of unlockable rewards” vick says. “these monologues allow us to tell a story with the character’s voice and give us a ton of room to explore their backgrounds their worldviews and a glimpse into the larger crucible universe. over time we hope to release more of these monologues both to flesh out the characters more and to tie into events that we plan to introduce in the game.,
MC,P,1,69,5,69,0,16,400,258,54,690,112,“speaking of those events it seemed a shame to us that multiplayer games often introduce an interesting premise some interesting characters and then…that’s it. they aren’t allowed to grow or progress in their plot in the same way that the best single-player games do. so while i can’t give specifics just yet we hope to keep players’ interest long-term by progressing and evolving the story of crucible over time.”,

MC,P,1,5,4,5,0,16,400,258,-2939,690,22,i’m one of those people.,
MC,P,3,119,4,119,0,16,400,258,-2895,690,202,i love the idea of . i enjoy playing the game even. but i seem to be cursed. every year or so i sit down to play it full of resolve to see it through to the end. but every damn time despite finding myself increasingly drawn in to its meticulously crafted fantasy world and despite revelling in my role as a sort of ultra-violent hagrid within it i only ever manage a handful of hours before getting distracted and drifting away from the game. by the time i’ve got the urge to come back again i’ve forgotten what was going on. and so i start again like a gaming sisyphus forever pushing a grumpy mutant up a hill.,the witcher 3
MC,P,1,83,5,83,0,16,400,258,-2671,690,134,i’ve played the start of the witcher 3 five times now. and so to commemorate its fifth anniversary and my impending inevitable sixth attempt at playing it i’ve decided to see how much of the game i can remember and synopsise here without cheating and googling anything. i’m going to try and do this in one take so i can’t second guess myself and i’ve even done some illustrations to help with your immersion in the tale. so are you prepared? let’s go!,
MC,H3,1,7,4,7,0,19,900,258,-2514,690,26,the plot of the witcher 3 explained,
MC,P,1,122,4,122,0,16,400,258,-2480,690,179,gerald rivers is a witcher: he’s a bit like a jedi crossed with a pest control man crossed with a fight. he’s miserable battered right up and usually pretty horny. he wears a special necklace of a spiky wolf because it’s the symbol of the school he lives at where other witchers (who i think have to be orphans) get trained in which buttons to press to block during fights. the game opens on him having a relaxing bath but his girlfriend (who is a wizard of sorts) decides to have a bit of a lol by putting a scorpion in with him. gerald isn’t amused by the scorpion but slaying it makes him predictably horny and i believe they have sex.,
MC,P,1,28,4,28,0,16,400,258,-2279,690,45,anyway he’s then hauled out of the shag zone by an even more miserable even older witcher who forces him to race a child through an obstacle course.,
MC,P,1,63,4,63,0,16,400,258,-2211,690,90,the race does not finish however because a massive flying pirate ship appears in the sky and beside it there are a load of guys who look like the lich king off of  doing wheelies on their horses in mid air. these fellows are the wild hunt and they are in the game’s title. here’s the main idiot of the wild hunt:,warcraft
MC,P,1,132,5,132,0,16,400,258,-1689,690,202,anyway the lich kings steal the child and gerald is very pissed off. so he begins an adventure. there’s a really good cutscene of gerald absolutely caning it across the landscape on his horse spliced with shots of his wizard girlfriend on a big mad battlefield. i’m confused by this in retrospect because i thought she had just been with him when he had his sexy bath but perhaps we’ve jumped elsewhere in time and now she has done a runner? anyway gerald is very anxious to find her (and presumably the child the wild hunt nicked?) so he properly aragorns the site of the battle sniffing at footprints and stuff until his special witcher vision shows him a clue. i think his wolf jewellery glows yellow when he uses his powers.,
MC,P,1,7,4,7,0,16,400,258,-1465,690,22,this is gerald’s horse by the way:,
MC,P,1,112,4,112,0,16,400,258,-1009,690,157,gerald’s instincts lead him to a town which is in the middle of a war. he asks some people in a pub about his girlfriend but they are meatheads and are bigoted to him and so he has to sword them all up instead. but at least he learns to play a collectible card game. there are ghouls hanging around on the outskirts of town because they love the corpses from off of the war and there are frog dudes in the water who try to strangle gerald because they are angry at having drowned and want to see how he likes it for a change. a dwarf calls gerald a c*nt.,
MC,P,1,112,4,112,0,16,400,258,-830,690,157,then he’s sent out into the countryside to have a chat with an army man. the army man won’t help gerald until he beasts a griffin that has been eating all the businessmen who try to come to the town so gerald gathers together loads of herbs and spices to brew up poisons and that. i know this sounds crazy but i am almost certain gerald acquires an actual gun. gerald waits by an old windmill for the griffin to show up and it’s worth the wait because it’s an utterly sick bit of creature design. gerald doesn’t care though he just shoots it right in the ticker with his witcher gun:,
MC,P,1,119,4,119,0,16,400,258,-241,690,157,well after that things get a bit hazy. i think there’s a cool old woman you visit to get more herbs and stuff and she’s got a long laundry list of local monsters for you to do in. one of them is some sort of turbo ghost who lives in a well and then comes out of it all on fire to absolutely dismantle people. gerald beats it up but then feels a bit bad about it because i think it was a girl whose husband strangled her when they were meant to be getting married or something and then chucked her in the well. anyway gerald’s not a bad sort because she’s been able to rest at last.,
MC,P,1,117,4,117,0,16,400,258,-61,690,157,i think the wild hunt men show up in their big ship again and one of them points at gerald. they both get very cross. and that i am afraid is all that i really remember. alice bee told me earlier she’s fairly sure the wild hunt don’t have a pirate ship and i have since remembered that the last time i played the witcher 3 i was on a massive dose of painkillers because my knee was a disaster but i’m still certain there was a big flying pirate ship. i guess i’ll have to go back once again and find out. in the meantime though i hope i’ve impressed you with my powers of recall.,
MC,P,1,18,5,18,0,16,400,258,118,690,45,(disclaimer for witcher superfans: i am not dissing the game. it is very good from what i’ve experienced.),

MC,P,1,60,5,60,0,18,300,227,-467,740,144,there are not a lot of details for  just yet — ubisoft has only released an initial teaser image (created in a live stream by artist kode abdo also known as bosslogic). but the promotional art shows off the norse-inspired setting for the upcoming game including a bearded grizzled viking warrior wielding an axe that  isn’t kratos from 2018’s .,

MC,P,1,52,5,52,0,22,300,396,-6899,730,172,is creating a new kind of office document. instead of word excel or powerpoint the company has created lego blocks of office content that live on the web. the tables graphs and lists that you typically find in office documents are transforming into living collaborative modules that exist outside of traditional documents.,
MC,SPAN,1,1,8,1,1,22,300,481,-6895,70,24,icrosoft,
MC,P,1,61,4,61,0,18,300,396,-6706,730,115,microsoft calls its lego blocks fluid components and they can be edited in real time by anyone in any app. the idea is that you could create things like a table without having to switch to multiple apps to get it done and the table will persist on the web like a lego block free for anyone to use and edit.,
MC,P,1,48,5,48,0,18,300,396,-6569,730,115,“imagine you could take those lego pieces and put them in any place you wanted: in emails in chats in other apps” explains jared spataro head of microsoft 365 in an interview with “as people work on them they will always be updated and contain the latest information.”,
MC,P,1,66,5,66,0,18,300,396,-6432,730,144,microsoft’s fluid framework sounds a lot like google docs but it’s actually google docs on steroids. microsoft is so confident it has built the future of productivity it’s now open-sourcing its fluid framework so the rest of the world can help shape what it has created. some office.com users will even be able to start getting a taste of this fluid future in the coming months.,
MC,P,1,100,5,100,0,18,300,396,-5750,730,202,at the heart of the fluid framework is microsoft’s attempt to move away from the decades-old idea of creating and saving documents. typically you find the app that lets you create a table chart or list of tasks and then you make a document save it and share it so people can contribute collaboratively. that’s how google docs works allowing multiple people to jump in and edit a document in real time. it’s something we keep seeing in new web-based apps and it helped make docs a success at a time when microsoft was still focused on dedicated desktop-focused apps.,
MC,P,1,44,5,44,0,18,300,396,-5527,730,86,microsoft is now trying to meet office users right where they’re working on daily tasks. the idea is to be able to create these fluid components in any app and then immediately share them without switching to a dedicated app in the first place.,
MC,P,1,40,5,40,0,18,300,396,-5419,730,86,“it’s about helping people achieve a particular task” explains maya rodriguez a principal program manager on microsoft’s fluid framework. “it’s not about requiring them to decide ‘which app do i go to?’ or ‘which document do i get back to?’”,
MC,P,1,88,5,88,0,18,300,396,-5289,730,173,fluid is designed to make those tables charts and lists always feel alive and editable no matter where you create them and regardless of how you share and copy them into other apps. instead of getting a static and dull chart you copied from excel you’ll get a chart that can be edited anywhere you paste it and you’ll see everyone making edits as they happen. that might be in the middle of an email chain in a chat app like microsoft teams or even third-party apps eventually.,
MC,P,1,63,5,63,0,18,300,396,-5095,730,144,“unlike a document i like to think of a fluid component as a little atomic unit of productivity” says spataro. “that fluid component is rendered entirely in-line in an experience in which it’s embedded.” microsoft sees fluid as key to the future of productivity and an entirely new way to collaborate that goes beyond google docs or the company’s own existing office.com work.,
MC,P,1,67,5,67,0,18,300,396,-4357,730,144,fluid is incredibly fast too allowing multiple people to edit a single component or an entire workspace full of fluid components in real time. “a lot of what’s gone into fluid is the concept of being freaky-fast” explains jon friedman corporate vice president of design and research at microsoft. “it’s truly real time for 5 10 15 or 100 people to do things at the same time.”,
MC,P,2,55,5,55,0,18,300,396,-4191,730,115,microsoft is now bringing fluid to office.com in preview this week after showing off some early examples . microsoft 365 enterprise and education subscribers will be able to create dynamic documents that multiple people can update in real time or use special fluid components like tables agendas and task lists within outlook on the web.,last year
MC,P,1,48,5,48,0,18,300,396,-4033,730,115,fluid components will show up with a special outline indicating they’re alive in outlook on the web. and much like existing office collaborative tools you’ll see the avatars of people who are currently editing a fluid component live and in real time within the email it’s embedded into.,
MC,P,1,74,5,74,0,18,300,396,-3896,730,144,the fluid rollout will be gradual starting initially with office.com and outlook on the web before appearing in microsoft teams later this year and even desktop versions of outlook next year. the goal is to eventually build fluid components into all office apps like excel word and powerpoint. at its build developer conference this week microsoft is also detailing how third-party devs will be able to take advantage of fluid in their own apps.,
MC,P,1,96,6,96,0,18,300,396,-3731,730,230,“fluid for developers is a web-based framework that you can use to instantly make your apps collaborative” explains spataro. “it provides data structures that perform low-latency synchronization. those data structures connect between themselves with a relay service and that relay service is designed to connect endpoints.” that means developers can use fluid to replace a static string in their app so it’s switched out into something that’s synchronized with everyone who boots up the app. microsoft is providing more documentation and tools on how to achieve this and the hope is that developers will embrace fluid.,
MC,P,1,62,4,62,0,18,300,396,-2764,730,173,“the future of productivity will not be invented by a single company — not by microsoft not by any of our competitors. it will be invented by the world” declares spataro. “it is our desire to enable that future to be invented and to participate in that. we think that’s the way to go forward and that’s the model that will work.”,
MC,P,1,96,5,96,0,18,300,396,-2570,730,317,microsoft open-sourcing fluid framework might have sounded surprising five years ago but the company has been gradually adopting and embracing open-source technologies since satya nadella took charge back in 2014. “we do think it’s a new day. this is the world in which microsoft is collaborating with google on the chromium open-source project so we think anything is possible” explains spataro. “we just think that’s good for all of us. we think the innovation that happens when people work together far outweighs any of the things you give up in doing it in a closed way.”,
MC,P,1,100,6,100,0,18,300,396,-2121,730,230,microsoft has been building its fluid framework for around 18 months now with approximately 140 employees now contributing to the preview. microsoft technical fellow steve lucco who also helped pioneer typescript inside the company headed up a small team initially with a vision of making it easier to create collaborative apps. “steve lucco looked at it from the fundamental level of ‘what if we built every experience on top of a data structure that was inherently distributed?’” says dan costenaro a principal product manager on microsoft’s fluid framework. “that’s how fluid framework was born initially just a super powerful concept.”,
MC,P,1,102,5,102,0,18,300,396,-1869,730,202,the basic concepts of fluid have been used by many in preview over more than six months and microsoft says it has seen a big demand from third-party developers. “the interest we got was absolutely overwhelming” explains dan zarzar a partner group product manager on microsoft’s fluid framework. “out of the thousands of submissions we got of people wanting to work with us we right now have only been able to take eight to 15 of those partners.” microsoft is now planning to document fluid framework and make it open source in the coming weeks so many more can contribute to it.,
MC,P,8,93,4,93,0,18,300,396,-892,730,202,fluid is now a big part of microsoft’s future that increasingly looks linked to the web too. microsoft made the bold move to  and work with google on the future of the web. fluid is the next natural step in microsoft’s embrace of open source and the web. “as we looked forward to the future … we started to recognize the web is where it’s at” says spataro. “deciding to use web technologies as the basis of what we’re creating ultimately wasn’t all that difficult because of the way the world has gone.”,shift its edge browser to the chromium codebase
MC,P,1,61,5,61,0,18,300,396,-669,730,144,the future of fluid framework depends on so much more than just microsoft. apple attempted its own opendoc multiplatform as a rival to microsoft’s object linking and embedding (ole) back in the ‘90s and google even thought it had solved the idea of real-time collaborative online editing with google wave. both apple and google failed to seriously dent microsoft’s office dominance.,
MC,P,1,47,5,47,0,18,300,396,-503,730,115,these days microsoft has to compete against a sea of rivals that have created online collaborative software for a variety of solutions. it’s these separate apps and developers that microsoft really needs to convince if it’s going to succeed in making fluid a true new industry standard.,
MC,P,1,25,5,25,0,18,300,396,-367,730,58,microsoft is now leaning on everyone else to help it shape fluid because it doesn’t have all the answers for how it will ultimately evolve.,
MC,P,1,20,5,20,0,18,300,396,-287,730,58,“you can see the potential in where it’s going” admits spataro “but not all the choices have yet been made.”,

MC,H2,1,4,8,4,0,23,400,350,-272,620,32,introduction to logistic regression,
MC,P,1,35,6,35,0,15,400,353,-230,614,62,logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. the nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous which means there would be only two possible classes.,
MC,P,1,24,5,24,0,15,400,353,-158,614,42,in simple words the dependent variable is binary in nature having data coded as either 1 (stands for success/yes) or 0 (stands for failure/no).,
MC,P,1,37,6,37,0,15,400,353,-108,614,62,mathematically a logistic regression model predicts p(y=1) as a function of x. it is one of the simplest ml algorithms that can be used for various classification problems such as spam detection diabetes prediction cancer detection etc.,
MC,H2,1,4,6,4,0,23,400,350,-25,620,32,types of logistic regression,
MC,P,1,42,6,42,0,15,400,353,17,614,62,generally logistic regression means binary logistic regression having binary target variables but there can be two more categories of target variables that can be predicted by it. based on those number of categories logistic regression can be divided into following types −,
MC,H3,1,3,5,3,0,18,400,350,99,620,28,binary or binomial,
MC,P,1,35,5,35,0,15,400,353,137,614,62,in such a kind of classification a dependent variable will have only two possible types either 1 and 0. for example these variables may represent success or failure yes or no win or loss etc.,
MC,H3,1,1,11,1,1,18,400,350,220,620,28,multinomial,
MC,P,1,36,5,36,0,15,400,353,258,614,62,in such a kind of classification dependent variable can have 3 or more possible  types or the types having no quantitative significance. for example these variables may represent “type a” or “type b” or “type c”.,
MC,H3,1,1,7,1,1,18,400,350,340,620,28,ordinal,
MC,P,1,43,5,43,0,15,400,353,378,614,83,in such a kind of classification dependent variable can have 3 or more possible  types or the types having a quantitative significance. for example these variables may represent “poor” or “good” “very good” “excellent” and each category can have the scores like 0123.,
MC,H2,1,3,10,3,0,23,400,350,481,620,32,logistic regression assumptions,
MC,P,1,20,5,20,0,15,400,353,523,614,42,before diving into the implementation of logistic regression we must be aware of the following assumptions about the same −,
MC,P,1,24,5,24,0,15,400,412,574,555,42,in case of binary logistic regression the target variables must be binary always and the desired outcome is represented by the factor level 1.,
MC,P,1,20,6,20,0,15,400,412,624,555,42,there should not be any multi-collinearity in the model which means the independent variables must be independent of each other.,
MC,P,1,8,5,8,0,15,400,412,675,555,21,we must include meaningful variables in our model.,
MC,P,1,10,5,10,0,15,400,412,705,555,21,we should choose a large sample size for logistic regression.,
MC,H2,1,2,8,2,1,23,400,350,746,620,32,regression models,
MC,P,4,30,5,30,0,15,400,412,788,555,62,− the simplest form of logistic regression is binary or binomial logistic regression in which the target or dependent variable can have only 2 possible types either 1 or 0.,binary logistic regression model
MC,P,4,32,5,32,0,15,400,412,859,555,83,− another useful form of logistic regression is multinomial logistic regression in which the target or dependent variable can have 3 or more possible  types i.e. the types having no quantitative significance.,multinomial logistic regression model
MC,H1,1,5,7,5,0,28,400,350,-2315,620,79,classification algorithms - naïve bayes,
MC,H2,1,5,7,5,0,23,400,350,-2138,620,32,introduction to naïve bayes algorithm,
MC,P,1,96,5,96,0,15,400,353,-2096,614,146,naïve bayes algorithms is a classification technique based on applying bayes’ theorem with a strong assumption that all the predictors are independent to each other. in simple words the assumption is that the presence of a feature in a class is independent to the presence of any other feature in the same class. for example a phone may be considered as smart if it is having touch screen internet facility good camera etc. though all these features are dependent on each other they contribute independently to the probability of that the phone is a smart phone.,
MC,P,1,41,5,41,0,15,400,353,-1941,614,62,in bayesian classification the main interest is to find the posterior probabilities i.e. the probability of a label given some observed features 𝑃(𝐿 | 𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠). with the help of bayes theorem we can express this in quantitative form as follows −,
MC,SPAN,1,1,1,1,1,18,400,527,-1840,12,17,l,
MC,P,1,10,6,10,0,15,400,353,-1773,614,21,here (𝐿 | 𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠) is the posterior probability of class.,
MC,P,1,7,5,7,0,15,400,353,-1743,614,21,𝑃(𝐿) is the prior probability of class.,
MC,P,1,12,7,12,0,15,400,353,-1713,614,21,𝑃(𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠|𝐿) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given class.,
MC,P,1,7,8,7,0,15,400,353,-1684,614,21,𝑃(𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠) is the prior probability of predictor.,
MC,H2,1,7,5,7,0,23,400,350,-1643,620,32,building model using naïve bayes in python,
MC,P,1,36,5,36,0,15,400,353,-1601,614,62,python library scikit learn is the most useful library that helps us to build a naïve bayes model in python. we have the following three types of naïve bayes model under scikit learn python library −,
MC,H3,1,3,6,3,0,18,400,350,-1518,620,28,gaussian naïve bayes,
MC,P,1,23,5,23,0,15,400,353,-1480,614,42,it is the simplest naïve bayes classifier having the assumption that the data from each label is drawn from a simple gaussian distribution.,
MC,H3,1,3,7,3,0,18,400,350,-1419,620,28,multinomial naïve bayes,
MC,P,1,38,6,38,0,15,400,353,-1381,614,62,another useful naïve bayes classifier is multinomial naïve bayes in which the features are assumed to be drawn from a simple multinomial distribution. such kind of naïve bayes are most appropriate for the features that represents discrete counts.,
MC,H3,1,3,6,3,0,18,400,350,-1298,620,28,bernoulli naïve bayes,
MC,P,1,33,5,33,0,15,400,353,-1260,614,62,another important model is bernoulli naïve bayes in which features are assumed to be binary (0s and 1s). text classification with ‘bag of words’ model can be an application of bernoulli naïve bayes.,
MC,H3,1,1,7,1,1,18,400,350,-1178,620,28,example,
MC,P,1,27,5,27,0,15,400,353,-1140,614,42,depending on our data set we can choose any of the naïve bayes model explained above. here we are implementing gaussian naïve bayes model in python −,
MC,P,1,9,4,9,0,15,400,353,-1089,614,21,we will start with required imports as follows −,
MC,P,1,18,4,18,0,15,400,353,-975,614,42,now by using  function of  we can generate blobs of points with gaussian distribution as follows −,
MC,I,1,1,12,1,1,15,400,456,-973,91,17,make_blobs(),
MC,P,1,15,4,15,0,15,400,353,-839,614,21,next for using  model we need to import and make its object as follows −,
MC,P,1,18,4,18,0,15,400,353,-725,614,21,now we have to do prediction. it can be done after generating some new data as follows −,
MC,P,1,11,4,11,0,15,400,353,-610,614,21,next we are plotting new data to find its boundaries −,
MC,P,1,21,5,21,0,15,400,353,-477,614,42,now with the help of following line of codes we can find the posterior probabilities of first and second label −,

MC,H2,1,3,3,3,0,23,400,350,-96,620,32,pros & cons,
MC,H3,1,1,4,1,1,18,400,350,-44,620,28,pros,
MC,P,1,11,5,11,0,15,400,353,-6,614,21,the followings are some pros of using naïve bayes classifiers −,
MC,P,1,9,5,9,0,15,400,412,24,555,21,naïve bayes classification is easy to implement and fast.,
MC,P,1,10,7,10,0,15,400,412,54,555,21,it will converge faster than discriminative models like logistic regression.,
MC,P,1,5,5,5,0,15,400,412,83,555,21,it requires less training data.,
MC,P,1,18,5,18,0,15,400,412,113,555,42,it is highly scalable in nature or they scale linearly with the number of predictors and data points.,
MC,P,1,14,5,14,0,15,400,412,164,555,42,it can make probabilistic predictions and can handle continuous as well as discrete data.,
MC,P,1,16,6,16,0,15,400,412,214,555,42,naïve bayes classification algorithm can be used for binary as well as multi-class classification problems both.,
MC,H3,1,1,4,1,1,18,400,350,276,620,28,cons,
MC,P,1,11,5,11,0,15,400,353,314,614,21,the followings are some cons of using naïve bayes classifiers −,
MC,P,1,36,5,36,0,15,400,412,344,555,62,one of the most important cons of naïve bayes classification is its strong feature independence because in real life it is almost impossible to have a set of features which are completely independent of each other.,
MC,P,1,48,5,48,0,15,400,412,415,555,83,another issue with naïve bayes classification is its ‘zero frequency’ which means that if a categorial variable has a category but not being observed in training data set then naïve bayes model will assign a zero probability to it and it will be unable to make a prediction.,
MC,H2,1,5,8,5,0,23,400,350,518,620,32,applications of naïve bayes classification,
MC,P,1,11,6,11,0,15,400,353,560,614,21,the following are some common applications of naïve bayes classification −,
MC,P,1,19,5,19,0,15,400,412,590,555,42,− due to its ease of implementation and fast computation it can be used to do prediction in real-time.,
MC,P,1,18,6,18,0,15,400,412,641,555,42,− naïve bayes classification algorithm can be used to predict posterior probability of multiple classes of target variable.,
MC,P,1,33,6,33,0,15,400,412,691,555,62,− due to the feature of multi-class prediction naïve bayes classification algorithms are well suited for text classification. that is why it is also used to solve problems like spam-filtering and sentiment analysis.,
MC,P,1,35,5,35,0,15,400,412,763,555,62,− along with the algorithms like collaborative filtering naïve bayes makes a recommendation system which can be used to filter unseen information and to predict weather a user would like the given resource or not.,
MC,H1,1,4,7,4,0,28,400,350,-1723,620,79,clustering algorithms - overview,
MC,H2,1,3,8,3,0,23,400,350,-1546,620,32,introduction to clustering,
MC,P,1,39,5,39,0,15,400,353,-1504,614,62,clustering methods are one of the most useful unsupervised ml methods. these methods are used to find similarity as well as the relationship patterns among data samples and then cluster those samples into groups having similarity based on features.,
MC,P,1,35,6,35,0,15,400,353,-1433,614,62,clustering is important because it determines the intrinsic grouping among the present unlabeled data. they basically make some assumptions about data points to constitute their similarity. each assumption will construct different but equally valid clusters.,
MC,P,1,21,5,21,0,15,400,353,-1361,614,42,for example below is the diagram which shows clustering system grouped together the similar kind of data in different clusters −,
MC,H2,1,3,8,3,0,23,400,350,-1105,620,32,cluster formation methods,
MC,P,1,20,5,20,0,15,400,353,-1063,614,42,it is not necessary that clusters will be formed in spherical form. followings are some other cluster formation methods −,
MC,H3,1,1,13,1,1,18,400,350,-1001,620,28,density-based,
MC,P,1,48,6,48,0,15,400,353,-963,614,83,in these methods the clusters are formed as the dense region. the advantage of these methods is that they have good accuracy as well as good ability to merge two clusters. ex. density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (dbscan) ordering points to identify clustering structure (optics) etc.,
MC,H3,1,1,18,1,1,18,400,350,-860,620,28,hierarchical-based,
MC,P,1,43,6,43,0,15,400,353,-822,614,83,in these methods the clusters are formed as a tree type structure based on the hierarchy. they have two categories namely agglomerative (bottom up approach) and divisive (top down approach). ex. clustering using representatives (cure) balanced iterative reducing clustering using hierarchies (birch) etc.,
MC,H3,1,1,12,1,1,18,400,350,-719,620,28,partitioning,
MC,P,1,35,6,35,0,15,400,353,-681,614,62,in these methods the clusters are formed by portioning the objects into k clusters. number of clusters will be equal to the number of partitions. ex. k-means clustering large applications based upon randomized search (clarans).,
MC,H3,1,1,4,1,1,18,400,350,-598,620,28,grid,
MC,P,1,46,5,46,0,15,400,353,-560,614,83,in these methods the clusters are formed as a grid like structure. the advantage of these methods is that all the clustering operation done on these grids are fast and independent of the number of data objects. ex. statistical information grid (sting) clustering in quest (clique).,
MC,H2,1,3,10,3,0,23,400,350,-457,620,32,measuring clustering performance,
MC,P,1,41,5,41,0,15,400,353,-415,614,62,one of the most important consideration regarding ml model is assessing its performance or you can say model’s quality. in case of supervised learning algorithms assessing the quality of our model is easy because we already have labels for every example.,
MC,P,1,44,5,44,0,15,400,353,-344,614,62,on the other hand in case of unsupervised learning algorithms we are not that much blessed because we deal with unlabeled data. but still we have some metrics that give the practitioner an insight about the happening of change in clusters depending on algorithm.,
MC,P,1,52,5,52,0,15,400,353,-272,614,83,before we deep dive into such metrics we must understand that these metrics only evaluates the comparative performance of models against each other rather than measuring the validity of the model’s prediction. followings are some of the metrics that we can deploy on clustering algorithms to measure the quality of model −,
MC,H2,1,2,9,2,1,23,400,350,-169,620,32,silhouette analysis,
MC,P,1,53,5,53,0,15,400,353,-127,614,83,silhouette analysis used to check the quality of clustering model by measuring the distance between the clusters. it basically provides us a way to assess the parameters like number of clusters with the help of . this score measures how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighboring clusters.,
MC,H2,1,4,6,4,0,23,400,350,-24,620,32,analysis of silhouette score,
MC,P,4,7,3,7,1,15,400,412,18,555,21,− the range of  is [-1 1].,analysis of silhouette score
MC,H2,1,5,6,5,0,23,400,350,59,620,32,types of ml clustering algorithms,
MC,P,1,12,5,12,0,15,400,353,101,614,21,the following are the most important and useful ml clustering algorithms −,
MC,H3,1,2,9,2,1,18,400,350,142,620,28,k-means clustering,
MC,P,1,44,5,44,0,15,400,353,180,614,83,this clustering algorithm computes the centroids and iterates until we it finds optimal centroid. it assumes that the number of clusters are already known. it is also called  algorithm. the number of clusters identified from data by algorithm is represented by ‘k’ in k-means.,
MC,H3,1,2,10,2,1,18,400,350,283,620,28,mean-shift algorithm,
MC,P,1,25,6,25,0,15,400,353,321,614,42,it is another powerful clustering algorithm used in unsupervised learning. unlike k-means clustering it does not make any assumptions hence it is a non-parametric algorithm.,
MC,H3,1,2,11,2,1,18,400,350,383,620,28,hierarchical clustering,
MC,P,1,19,6,19,0,15,400,353,421,614,42,it is another unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to group together the unlabeled data points having similar characteristics.,
MC,P,1,13,5,13,0,15,400,353,471,614,21,we will be discussing all these algorithms in detail in the upcoming chapters.,
MC,H2,1,3,8,3,0,23,400,350,512,620,32,applications of clustering,
MC,P,1,10,5,10,0,15,400,353,554,614,21,we can find clustering useful in the following areas −,
MC,P,1,26,6,26,0,15,400,353,584,614,62,− clustering is widely used in the areas where we require data summarization compression and reduction as well. the examples are image processing and vector quantization.,
MC,P,1,28,5,28,0,15,400,353,655,614,62,− since clustering can be used to find similar products or same kind of users it can be used in the area of collaborative systems and customer segmentation.,
MC,P,1,29,6,29,0,15,400,353,727,614,62,− cluster analysis can generate a compact summary of data for classification testing hypothesis generation; hence it serves as a key intermediate step for other data mining tasks also.,
MC,P,1,19,5,19,0,15,400,353,798,614,42,− clustering can also be used for trend detection in dynamic data by making various clusters of similar trends.,
MC,P,1,19,5,19,0,15,400,353,849,614,42,− clustering can be used in social network analysis. the examples are generating sequences in images videos or audios.,
MC,P,1,22,5,22,0,15,400,353,899,614,42,− clustering can also be used to make clusters of images videos hence it can successfully be used in biological data analysis.,

NC,SPAN,1,49,5,49,0,13,400,280,1098,617,48,the real crime here is that even when the maps call is encapsulated in a try / catch statement somehow google maps supercedes your try call and crashes the app instead of throwing an error. maps should throw a proper exception when it's not available not just crash everything.,

NC,P,1,35,5,35,0,15,400,270,2183,631,58,the workarounds provided here covers all available flavors and versions of our sdks for android. to clarify further (in case you released an earlier version of the workaround that did not delete as many files):,
NC,P,1,38,8,38,0,15,400,270,2255,631,96,applications that use maps android sdk v2 should only need to delete one file: zoomtables.data.  applications that use maps android sdk v3 beta should only need to delete one file either data_servercontrolledparametersmanager.data.v1. + getbasecontext().getpackagename()) or data_servercontrolledparametersmanager.data. + getbasecontext().getpackagename()),

NC,SPAN,1,64,4,64,0,13,400,278,4884,624,65,i have just pushed out a similar workaround.  as i have alternative mapping sources to google in my app i change the default source not to be google as well giving the user a message explaining what has been done.  hopefully it will keep me safe if google manage to do something similar in the future.  i do expect there testing to improve though.,

NC,SPAN,1,41,5,41,0,13,400,278,4964,624,48,i had to clear storage to resolve this issue.  for whatever reason deleting zoomtables.data wasn't enough to resolve this for me.  i did the delete in my startup activity oncreate().  i guess i should look into the application scope exception handler.,

NC,P,2,46,5,46,0,15,400,254,1495,659,77,macos provides an undocumented rand() function in stdlib. if you leave it unseeded then the first values it outputs are 16807 282475249 1622650073 984943658 and 1144108930. a  will show that this sequence corresponds to a very basic lcg random number generator that iterates the following formula:,quick search
NC,P,1,7,1,7,0,15,400,270,1599,631,22,= 7 ·  (mod 2 − 1),

NC,P,1,43,4,43,0,15,400,254,1648,659,61,since the state of this rng is described entirely by the value of a single 32-bit integer its period is not very long. to be precise it repeats itself every 2 − 2 iterations outputting every value from 1 to 2 − 2.,
NC,P,3,85,5,85,0,15,400,254,1724,659,115,i don't think there's a  implementation of rand() for all versions of linux but there is a  that is often used. instead of a single 32-bit state variable this uses a pool of over 1000 bits which to all intents and purposes will never produce a fully repeating sequence. again you can probably find out what version you have by printing the first few outputs from this rng without seeding it first. (the glibc rand() function produces the numbers 1804289383 846930886 1681692777 1714636915 and 1957747793.),glibc rand() function

NC,P,1,25,5,25,0,15,400,254,1854,659,38,so the reason you're getting more collisions in linux (and hardly any in macos) is that the linux version of rand() is basically more random.,

NC,P,1,87,4,87,0,15,400,254,3480,659,96,in general if you're going to use something from the standard library use random if you can (the man page lists it as posix standard back to posix.1-2001 but rand is standard way back before c was even standardized).  or better yet crack open numerical recipes (or look for it online) or knuth and implement one.  they're really easy and you only really need to do it once to have a general purpose rng with the attributes you most often need and which is of known quality.,

NC,P,1,125,6,125,0,16,400,347,-2712,602,282,historians anthropologists and political activists have offered various names none fully satisfactory. anthropologists have used “aborigine” but the term suggests a primitive level of existence inconsistent with the cultural level of many tribes. another term “amerindian” which combines columbus's error with the name of another italian explorer amerigo vespucci (whose name was the source of “america”) lacks any historical context. since the 1960s “native american” has come into popular favor though some activists prefer “american indian.” in the absence of a truly representative term descriptive references such as “native peoples” or “indigenous peoples” though vague avoid european influence. in recent years some argument has developed over whether to refer to tribes in the singular or plural—apache or apaches—with supporters on both sides demanding political correctness.,

NC,P,1,111,5,111,0,16,400,347,353,602,205,there is a tendency to view north american society at the end of the fifteenth century as a pre‐columbian garden of eden corrupted by the arrival of the europeans. this notion of an idyllic place where everyone was one with the environment and each other denies native peoples their own history. the mississippians for example practiced torture and human sacrifice as part of their death cult. tribes in the pacific northwest had a very rigid class structure based on private property and made slaves out of war captives and debtors. among the natchez in the southeast the hereditary nobles under the chief or “great sun” oppressed the majority of the tribe.,
